Checking the Installed Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check that you are using the installed version of newt:

.. code-block:: console

    $ which newt
    /usr/local/bin/newt
    $ newt version
    Apache Newt version: 1.4.1

**Note:** If you previously built newt from source and the output of
``which newt`` shows
"$GOPATH/bin/newt", you will need to move "$GOPATH/bin" after
"/usr/local/bin" for your PATH in ~/.bash_profile, and source
~/.bash_profile.

Get information about newt:

.. code-block:: console

    $ newt help

Installing Newt from the Master Branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that you use the latest release version of newt. If
you would like to use the master branch with the latest updates, you can
install newt from the HEAD of the master branch.

**Notes:**

-  The master branch may be unstable.
-  This installation will install the latest version of Go on your
   computer, if it is not installed, and compile newt locally.

If you previously installed newt using brew, unlink the current
version:

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew unlink mynewt-newt

Install the latest unstable version of newt from the master branch:

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew install mynewt-newt --HEAD

To switch back to the latest stable release version of newt,
you can run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew switch mynewt-newt 1.4.1
