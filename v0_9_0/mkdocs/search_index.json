The\nnewt command line tool and the entire build toolchain is available in a single\ndocker container. The container is all that's needed to run your Mynewt based\napplication in the simulator.  Enabling USB2 with your docker installation will\nallow you to load your application on a supported device.\n\n\nDocker is the only supported option if you are working on a Windows machine. If you are using Mac OS X or Linux, you have the choice of installing a Docker container of tools and toolchains or installing them natively. This chapter describes how to set up the Docker image for all three platforms.\n\n\n\n\nInstall Docker\n\n\nInstall docker for your platform. \nMac OS X\n / \nWindows\n / \nLinux\n\n\nMac and Windows\n\n\nMac and Windows require Docker Toolbox to interact with USB devices.  Docker\nfor Mac and Docker for Windows do not support USB. Docker Toolbox uses\nVirtualBox and allows you to map USB devices into docker containers as\ndescribed below.\n\n\nMake sure to double click the Docker Quickstart Terminal application if you're\non Mac or Windows.\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nThe docker daemon listens on a Unix domain socket on Linux.  That socket is\nowned by root, which means by default you must be root to start a container.\nMake sure to follow the optional step of adding yourself to the docker group so\nyou can start the newt container as yourself.\n\n\n\n\nUse the newt wrapper script\n\n\nUse the newt wrapper script to invoke newt.  Create the following file, name it\n\nnewt\n, make it executable, and put it in your path. This will allow you to run newt as if it was natively installed.  You can now follow the normal tutorials using the newt wrapper script.\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\n\nif\n \n[\n \n\"\n$1\n\"\n \n=\n \n\"debug\"\n \n]\n \n||\n \n[\n \n\"\n$1\n\"\n \n=\n \n\"run\"\n \n]\n\n\nthen\n\n    \nti=\n\"-ti\"\n\n\nfi\n\n\ndocker run -e \nNEWT_USER=\n$(\nid -u\n)\n -e \nNEWT_GROUP=\n$(\nid -g\n)\n -e \nNEWT_HOST=\n$(\nuname\n)\n \n$ti\n --rm --device\n=\n/dev/bus/usb --privileged -v \n$(pwd)\n:/workspace -w /workspace mynewt/newt:latest /newt \n\"\n$@\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1:\n Remember to point to the correct subdirectory level when invoking \nnewt\n. For example, invoke it using \n../newt\n in the example below.\n\n\nuser@~/dockertest$ ls\nmyproj  newt\nuser@~/dockertest$ cd myproj\n\nuser@~/dockertest/myproj$ ../newt version\n\nApache Newt (incubating) version: 0.8.0-b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2:\n You can upgrade your container by running \ndocker pull mynewt/newt:latest\n when updates are made available.\n\n\n\n\nEnable USB2 Support for Mac or Windows\n\n\nIf you plan on loading your application on an actual device, do the steps below.\n\n\n\n\nInstall VirtualBox extension pack\n\n\nDocker uses a VirtualBox Linux VM to run containers.  A free VirtualBox\nextension pack is required to enable USB2 support.  Download the \nVirtualBox\n5.0.16 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension\nPack\n\nand double click to install\n\n\n\n\nEnable USB2 and select your device\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"default\" VM created by docker-machine must first be stopped before you\n  can enable USB2.  You have two options:\n\n\n\n\nRun the command \ndocker-machine stop default\n in the terminal window or\n\n\nUse the VirtualBox UI. Right click on \ndefault\n -> Close -> Power Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable USB2 using the VirtualBox UI. Select the \"default\"\n  VM->Settings->Ports->USB2 to enable USB2.   Add your device to the USB Device\n  Filters to make the device visible in the docker container.  See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the \"default\" VM. You have two options:\n\n\nRun \ndocker-machine start default\n in the terminal window or \n\n\nUse the VirtualBox UI. Make sure the \"default\" machine is highlighted. Click the green \"Start\" button. Select \"Headless Start\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3\n: When working with actual hardware, remember that each board has an ID. If you swap boards and do not refresh the USB Device Filter on the VirtualBox UI, the ID might be stale and the Docker instance may not be able to see the board correctly. For example, you may see an error message like \nError: unable to find CMSIS-DAP device\n when you try to load or run an image on the board.

Install Homebrew on your Mac OS X\n\n\n\n\nDo you have Homebrew? If not, open a terminal on your Mac and paste the following at a Terminal prompt. It will ask you for your sudo password.\n\n\n\n\n        $ ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can just extract (or \ngit clone\n) Homebrew and install it to \n/usr/local\n.\n\n\n\n\n2. Install Go, the programming language\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo language environment dictates a directory structure. Known in Go parlanace as workspace, it must contain three sibling directories with the directory names src, pkg and bin, as explained below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsrc contains Go source files organized into packages (one package per directory),\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg contains package objects, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbin contains executable commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. To setup this workspace environment, create a 'dev' directory and then a 'go' directory under it. Set the GOPATH environment variable to this directory where you will soon clone the \nnewt\n tool repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd $HOME\n        $ mkdir -p dev/go  \n        $ cd dev/go\n        $ export GOPATH=`pwd`\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note that you need to add export statements to ~/.bash_profile to export variables permanently. Don't forget to source the file for the change to go into effect.)\n\n\n\n\n        $ vi ~/.bash_profile\n        $ source ~/.bash_profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, using \nbrew\n, install Go. When installed, Go offers you as a developer a language environment (to compile Go code), construct Go packages (to assemble Go packages) and import Go code (from github). In the next step, you will use the Go commands to import \nnewt\n repo into your local Go environment.\n\n\n\n\n        $ brew install go\n        ==> \n        ...\n        ... \n        ==> *Summary*\n        \ud83c\udf7a  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.5.1: 5330 files, 273M\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can download the Go package directly from (https://golang.org/dl/) instead of brewing it. Install it in /usr/local directory.\n\n\n\n\n3. Create local repository\n\n\n\n\nUse Go commands to copy the directory (currently the ASF incubator directory). Be patient as it may take a minute or two. Check the directories installed.\n\n\n\n\n        $ go get mynewt.apache.org/newt/...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that newt.go is in place.\n\n\n\n\n        $ ls $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt\n        DISCLAIMER  NOTICE      newt        newtvm      viper\n        LICENSE     README.md   newtmgr     util        yaml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Build the Newt tool\n\n\n\n\nUse Go to run the newt.go program to build the \nnewt\n tool. The command \ngo install\n compiles and writes the resulting executable to an output file named \nnewt\n, which is then installed, along with its dependencies, in $GOPATH/bin.\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt\n        $ go install\n        $ ls \"$GOPATH\"/bin/\n        newt newtmgr newtvm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, you can try using \nnewt\n. For example, check for the version number by typing 'newt version'. See all the possible commands available to a user of newt by typing 'newt -h'.\n\n\n\n\n(Note: If you are going to be modifying the \nnewt\n often and going to be compile the program every time you call it, you will want to store the command in a variable in your .bash_profile. So type in \nexport newt=\"go run $GOPATH/mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt/newt.go\"\n in your .bash_profile and execute it by calling \n$newt\n at the prompt instead of \nnewt\n. Essentially, \n$newt\n calls \ngo run\n which runs the compiled binary directly without producing an executable. Don't forget to reload the updated bash profile by typing \nsource ~/.bash_profile\n at the prompt! )\n\n\n        $ newt version\n        Newt version:  1.0\n        $ newt -h\n        Newt allows you to create your own embedded project based on the Mynewt\n        operating system.

You will see an output indicating that the \nhal_gpio\n pin is toggling between 1 and 0 in a simulated blink. \n\n\n\n\nComplete\n\n\nCongratulations, you have created your first project!  The blinky application\nis not terribly exciting when it is run in the simulator, as there is no LED to\nblink.  Apache Mynewt has a lot more functionality than just running simulated\napplications.  It provides all the features you'll need to cross-compile your\napplication, run it on real hardware and develop a full featured application.\n\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, a good next step is to dig in to one of\nthe \ntutorials\n and get a Mynewt project running on real hardware.\n\n\nHappy Hacking!",

Once built using the \nnewt\n tool, this application will blink the LED lights on the target board.\n\n\nThis tutorial describes how to run Mynewt OS on Arduino Zero. Follow these simple steps and your board will be blinking in no time!\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nBefore tackling this tutorial, it's best to read about Mynewt in the \nIntroduction\n section of this documentation.\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\nYou will need the following equipment\n\n\n\n\nAn Arduino Zero board.  NOTE: There are many flavors of Arduino. Ensure that \nyou have an Arduino Zero. See below for the versions of Arduino Zero that are\ncompatible with this tutorial\n\n\nA computer that can connect to the Arduino Zero over USB\n\n\nA USB cable (Type A to micro B) that can connect the computer to the Arduino\n\n\nThe Mynewt Release\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial has been tested on the following three Arduino Zero boards - Zero, M0 Pro, and Zero-Pro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMynewt has not been tested on Arduino M0 which has no internal debugger support.\n\n\nInstall Mynewt and Newt\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not already done so, install Newt as shown in the \nNewt install tutorial\n\n\nIf you have not already done so, create a project as shown in the Quick Start guide on how to \nCreate Your First Project\n. Skip the testing and building the project steps in that tutorial since you will be defining a target for your Arduino board in this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch External Packages\n\n\nMynewt uses source code provided directly from the chip manufacturer for \nlow level operations. Sometimes this code is licensed only for the specific manufacturer of the chipset and cannot live in the Apache Mynewt repository. That happens to be the case for the Arduino Zero board which uses Atmel SAMD21. Runtime's github repository hosts such external third-party packages and the Newt tool can fetch them.\n\n\nTo fetch the package with MCU support for Atmel SAMD21 for Arduino Zero from the Runtime git repository, you need to add \nthe repository to the \nproject.yml\n file in your base project directory.\n\n\nHere is an example \nproject.yml\n file with the Arduino Zero repository\nadded. The sections with \nmynewt_arduino_zero\n that need to be added to \nyour project file are highlighted.\n\n\n$ more project.yml \nproject.name: \"my_project\"\n\nproject.repositories:\n    - apache-mynewt-core\n\n    - mynewt_arduino_zero\n\n\nrepository.apache-mynewt-core:\n    type: github\n    vers: 0-latest\n    user: apache\n    repo: incubator-mynewt-core\n\n\nrepository.mynewt_arduino_zero:\n\n    type: github\n\n    vers: 0-latest\n\n    user: runtimeinc\n\n    repo: mynewt_arduino_zero\n\n$ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've edited your \nproject.yml\n file, the next step is to install the \nproject dependencies, this can be done with the \nnewt install\n command \n(to see more output, provide the \n-v\n verbose option.): \n\n\n$ newt install \napache-mynewt-core\nmynewt_arduino_zero\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n If there has been a new release of a repo used in your project since you last installed it, the \n0-latest\n version for the repo in the \nproject.yml\n file will refer to the new release and will not match the installed files. In that case you will get an error message saying so and you will need to run \nnewt upgrade\n to overwrite the existing files with the latest codebase.\n\n\n\n\nCreate your bootloader target\n\n\nNext, you need to tell Newt what to build.  For the Arduino Zero, we are going to \ngenerate both a bootloader, and an image target.\n\n\nTo generate the bootloader target, you need to specify the following options. The output of the commands (indicating success) have been suppressed for easier readability. \n\n\n$ newt target create arduino_boot \n$ newt target set arduino_boot bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero \n$ newt target set arduino_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot \n$ newt target set arduino_boot build_profile=optimized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an Arduino Zero Pro or M0 Pro, you have to set the following next:\n\n\n$ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero_pro \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an Arduino Zero, you have to set the following instead:\n\n\n$ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese commands do a few things: \n\n\n\n\nCreate a target named \narduino_boot\n, in order to build the Arduino Zero Bootloader.\n\n\nSet the application for the \narduino_boot\n target to the default Apache Mynewt \n    bootloader (\n@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot\n)\n\n\nSet the board support package for the target to \n    \n@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero\n.  This is a reference to the downloaded \n    Arduino Zero support from Github.\n\n\nUse the \"optimized\" build profile for the \narduino_boot\n target.

Set it to \narduino_zero\n or \narduino_zero_pro\n depending on the board you have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild your bootloader\n\n\nOnce you've configured the bootloader target, the next step is to build the bootloader for your Arduino. You can do this by using the \nnewt build\n command:\n\n\n$ newt build arduino_boot \nCompiling asprintf.c\nCompiling atoi.c\nCompiling atol.c\nCompiling atoll.c\nCompiling bsearch.c\nCompiling bzero.c\nCompiling calloc.c\nCompiling fgets.c\nCompiling inline.c\n<snip>\nApp successfully built: myproject/bin/arduino_boot/apps/boot/boot.elf\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this command finishes successfully, you have successfully built the Arduino \nbootloader, and the next step is to build your application for the Arduino \nboard.\n\n\n\n\nBuild your blinky app\n\n\nTo create and download your application, you create another target, this one pointing to the application you want to download to the Arduino board.  In this tutorial,  we will use the default application that comes with your project, \napps/blinky\n:\n\n\nNote\n: Remember to set features to \narduino_zero\n if your board is Arduino Zero and not a Pro!\n\n\n$ newt target create arduino_blinky \nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully created\n$ newt target set arduino_blinky app=apps/blinky \nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.app to apps/blinky\n$ newt target set arduino_blinky bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero\nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.bsp to @mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero\n$ newt target set arduino_blinky build_profile=debug \nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.build_profile to debug\n\n$ newt target set arduino_blinky features=arduino_zero_pro \n\nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully set pkg.features to arduino_zero_pro\n$ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now build the target, with \nnewt build\n: \n\n\n$ newt build arduino_blinky \nCompiling main.c\nArchiving blinky.a\nCompiling cons_fmt.c\nCompiling cons_tty.c\nArchiving full.a\nCompiling case.c\nCompiling suite.c\nCompiling testutil.c\nArchiving testutil.a\n<snip>\nApp successfully built: myproject/bin/arduino_blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf\n\n\n\n\n\n Congratulations! \n You have successfully built your application. Now it's time to load both the bootloader and application onto the target.\n\n\n\n\nConnect the Target\n\n\nConnect your computer to the Arduino Zero (from now on we'll call this the \ntarget) with the Micro-USB cable through the Programming Port as shown below. \nMynewt will download and debug the target through this port. You should see a \nlittle green LED come on. That means the board has power.\n\n\nNo external debugger is required.  The Arduino Zero comes with an internal\ndebugger that can be accessed by Mynewt.\n\n\nA image below shows the Arduino Zero Programming Port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the Bootloader\n\n\nExecute the command to download the bootloader. \n\n\n    \n$\n \nnewt\n \nload\n \narduino_boot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the newt tool finishes without error, that means the bootloader has been \nsuccessfully loaded onto the target.\n\n\n\n\n Reminder if you are using Docker: \n When working with actual hardware, remember that each board has an ID. If you swap boards and do not refresh the USB Device Filter on the VirtualBox UI, the ID might be stale and the Docker instance may not be able to see the board correctly. For example, you may see an error message like \nError: unable to find CMSIS-DAP device\n when you try to load or run an image on the board. In that case, you need to click on the USB link in VirtualBox UI, remove the existing USB Device Filter (e.g. \"Atmel Corp. EDBG CMSIS-DAP[0101]\") by clicking on the \"Removes selected USB filter\" button, and add a new filter by clicking on the \"Adds new USB filter\" button.\n\n\n\n\nRun the Image\n\n\nNow that the bootloader is downloaded to the target, the next step is to load \nyour image onto the Arduino Zero.  The easiest way to do this, is to use the \n\nnewt run\n command.  \nnewt run\n will automatically rebuild your program\n(if necessary), create an image, and load it onto the target device.\n\n\nHere, we will load our \narduino_blinky\n target onto the device, and we \nshould see it run:\n\n\n$ newt run arduino_blinky 0.0.0 \nDebugging myproject/bin/arduino_blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf\nOpen On-Chip Debugger 0.9.0 (2015-09-23-21:46)\nLicensed under GNU GPL v2\nFor bug reports, read\n    http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html\nInfo : only one transport option; autoselect 'swd'\nadapter speed: 500 kHz\nadapter_nsrst_delay: 100\ncortex_m reset_config sysresetreq\nInfo : CMSIS-DAP: SWD  Supported\nInfo : CMSIS-DAP: JTAG Supported\nInfo : CMSIS-DAP: Interface Initialised (SWD)\nInfo : CMSIS-DAP: FW Version = 01.1F.0118\nInfo : SWCLK/TCK = 1 SWDIO/TMS = 1 TDI = 1 TDO = 1 nTRST = 0 nRESET = 1\nInfo : CMSIS-DAP: Interface ready\nInfo : clock speed 500 kHz\nInfo : SWD IDCODE 0x0bc11477\nInfo : at91samd21g18.cpu: hardware has 4 breakpoints, 2 watchpoints\nGNU gdb (GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors) 7.8.0.20150604-cvs\nCopyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

However, the board support package for the Arduino Primo is different from the nRF52 dev kit board support package.\n\n\n\n\nHardware and Software needed\n\n\n\n\nArduino Primo\n\n\nLaptop running Mac OS\n\n\nA micro USB 2.0 cable to power the Arduino primo board\n\n\nIt is assumed you have already installed newt tool. \n\n\nIt is assumed you already installed native tools as described \nhere\n\n\nDebugger - choose one of the two options below.

By default, the linker script within the \nhw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n package builds an image for flash memory, which we don't want; instead, we want an image for the SRAM, so you need to switch that script with \nrun_from_sram.ld\n. \n\n\nAfer you build the target, you can find the executable \nblinky.elf\n in the project directory \n~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/.\n \n\n\n    $ cd ~/dev/myproj/repos/apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/\n    $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_sram.ld\n    (some diff will be displayed)\n    $ cp run_from_sram.ld olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld\n    $ cd ~/dev/myproj\n    $ newt build blinky\n    Compiling case.c\n    Compiling suite.c\n    ...\n    Linking blinky.elf\n    App successfully built:~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf\n    $ ls ~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/\n        blinky.elf      blinky.elf.bin     blinky.elf.cmd  \n        blinky.elf.lst  blinky.elf.map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the hardware to boot from embedded SRAM\n\n\n\n\nLocate the boot jumpers on the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB1_1/B1_0 and B0_1/B0_0 are PTH jumpers. Note that because the markings on the board may not always be accurate, when in doubt, you should always refer to the manual for the correct positioning. Since the jumpers are a pair, they should move together, and as such, the pair is responsible for the boot mode when bootloader is present. \nTo locate the bootloader, the board searches in three places: User Flash Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. For this Blinky project, we will configure it to boot from SRAM by jumpering \nB0_1\n and \nB1_1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect USB-OTG#2 in the picture above to a USB port on your computer (or a powered USB hub to make sure there is enough power available to the board). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red PWR LED should be lit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the JTAG connector to the SWD/JTAG interface on the board.

Connect USB-OTG#2 in the picture above to a USB port on your computer (or a powered USB hub to make sure there is enough power available to the board).     The red PWR LED should be lit.     Connect the JTAG connector to the SWD/JTAG interface on the board. The other end of the cable should be connected to the USB port or hub of your computer.",

            "text": "Adding Repositories to your Project\n\n\nWhat is a Repository\n\n\nA repository is a version-ed Mynewt project, which is a collection of Mynewt packages organized in a specific way for redistribution.  \n\n\nWhat differentiates a repository from a Mynewt project is the presence of a\n\nrepository.yml\n file describing the repository. This will be described \nbelow. For a basic understanding of repositories you may read the \nNewt Tool Manual\n and \nHow to create repos\n.\n\n\nNote:\n For the remainder of this document we'll use the term repo as shorthand for a Mynewt repository.\n\n\nRepos are useful because they are an organized way for the community to share Mynewt packages and projects.  In fact, the Mynewt-core is distributed as a repo.\n\n\n\n\nWhy does Mynewt need additional repos?\n\n\nRepos add functionality not included in the Mynewt core.  New repos might be created for several reasons.\n\n\n\n\nExpertise\n.  Individuals or organizations may have expertise that they want\nto share in the form of repos. For example a chip vendor may\ncreate a repo to hold the Mynewt support for their chips.\n\n\nNon-Core component\n.  Some components, although very useful to Mynewt users\nare not core to all Mynewt users.  These are likely candidates to be held in \ndifferent repos.\n\n\nSoftware licensing\n.  Some software have licenses that make them incompatible\nwith the ASF (Apache Software Foundation) license policies.  These may be \nvaluable components to some Mynewt users, but cannot be contained in the \napache-Mynewt-core\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Repos are in my Project\n\n\nThe list of repos used by your project are contained within the \n\nproject.yml\n file.  An example can be seen by creating a new project:\n\n\n$ mkdir ~/dev\n$ cd ~/dev\n$ newt new myproj\n$ cd myproj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the \nproject.yml\n section and you will see a line describing the repos:\n\n\nproject.repositories:\n    - apache-Mynewt-core\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBy default, this newly created project uses a single repo called \n\napache-Mynewt-core\n.  \n\n\nIf you wish to add additional repos, you would add \nadditional lines to the \nproject.repositories\n variable like this.\n\n\nproject.repositories:\n    - apache-Mynewt-core\n\n    - another_repo_named_x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo Descriptors\n\n\nIn addition to the repo name, the \nproject.yml\n file must also contain\na repo descriptor for each repository you include that gives \nnewt\n \ninformation on obtaining the repo.\n\n\nIn the same \nmyproj\n above you will see the following repo descriptor.\n\n\nrepository.apache-Mynewt-core:\n    type: github\n    vers: 0-latest\n    user: apache\n    repo: incubator-mynewt-core\n\n\n\n\n\nA repo descriptor starts with \nrepository.<name>.\n.  In this example, the \ndescriptor specifies the information for the \napache-Mynewt-core\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe fields within the descriptor have the following definitions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n -- The type of code storage the repo uses.  The current version\nof \nnewt\n only supports github.  Future versions may support generic git or other\ncode storage mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvers\n -- The version of the repo to use for your project.  A source\ncode repository contains many versions of the source. This field is used to \nspecify the one to use for this project.  See the section on versions below \nfor a detailed description of the format of this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser\n -- The username for the repo.  On github, this is the name\nafter \ngithub.com\n in the repo path.  Consider the repository \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core\n. It has username \napache\n.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrepo\n -- The name of the repo.  On github, this is the name after\nthe username described above.  Consider the repository \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core\n. It has username \n\nincubator-mynewt-core\n.  This is a path to the source control\nand should not be confused with the name of the repo that you used in the \n\nrepository.<name>\n declaration above.   That name is contained elsewhere\nwithin the repo. See Below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Existing Repos to my Project\n\n\nTo add a new repo to your project, you have to complete two steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \nproject.yml\n file and add a new repo descriptor.  The previous\nsection includes information on the field required in your repo descriptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \nproject/yml\n file and add a new line to the \nproject.repositories\n\nvariable with the name of the repo you are adding.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a \nproject.yml\n file with two repositories is shown below:\n\n\nproject.name: \"my_project\"\n\nproject.repositories:\n    - apache-Mynewt-core\n    - Mynewt_arduino_zero\n\n# Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries.\n# This provides mirroring automatically for us.\n#\nrepository.apache-Mynewt-core:\n    type: github\n    vers: 0-latest\n    user: apache\n    repo: incubator-mynewt-core\n\n# a special repo to hold hardware specific stuff for arduino zero\nrepository.Mynewt_arduino_zero:\n    type: github\n    vers: 0-latest\n    user: runtimeinc\n    repo: Mynewt_arduino_zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Version of the Repo to use\n\n\nMynewt repos are version-ed artifacts.  They are stored in source control \nsystems like github.  The repo descriptor in your \nproject.yml\n file must\nspecify the version of the repo you will accept into your project.\n\n\nFor now, we are at the beginnings of Mynewt. For testing and evaluation\nplease use \n0-latest\n in the \nvers\n field in your repo descriptor.\n\n\n    vers:0-latest\n\n\n\n\n\nSee \nCreate a Repo\n for a description of the versioning system and all the possible ways to specify a version to use.\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying a Repo\n\n\nA repo contains Mynewt packages organized in a specific way and stored in one of the supported code storage methods described above. In other words, it is a Mynewt project with an additional file \nrepository.yml\n which describes the repo for use by \nnewt\n (and humans browsing them). It contains a mapping of version numbers to the actual github branches containing the source code.\n\n\nNote that the \nrepository.yml\n file lives only in the master branch of the git\nrepository.  \nNewt\n will always fetch this file from the master branch and then\nuse that to determine the actual branch required depending on the version\nspecified in your \nproject.yml\n file.  Special care should be taken to ensure that this file exists only in the master branch.\n\n\nHere is the \nrepository.yml\n file from the apache-Mynewt-core:\n\n\nrepo.name: apache-mynewt-core\nrepo.versions:\n    \"0.7.9\": \"Mynewt_0_8_0_b2_tag\"\n    \"0-latest\": \"0.7.9\"\n    \"0.8-latest\": \"0.7.9\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt contains the following:\n\n\n\n\nrepo.name\n The external name that is used to include the library in \nyour \nproject.yml\n file.   This is the name you in include in the \nproject.repositories\n variable when adding this repository to your project.\n\n\nrepo.versions\n A description of what versions to give the user depending \non the settings in their \nproject.yml\n file.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo Version\n\n\nThe repo version number resolves to an actual git branch depending on the mapping specified in \nrepository.yml\n for that repo. The version field argument in your \nproject.yml\n file supports multiple formats for flexibility:\n\n\n<major_num>.<minor_num>.<revision_num>\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n<major_num>.<minor_num>-<stability string>\n\n\n\n\n\nor \n\n\n<major_num>-<stability string>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stability string can be one of 3 pre-defined stability values.\n\n\n\n\nstable -- A stable release version of the repository\n\n\ndev    -- A development version from the repository\n\n\nlatest -- The latest from the repository\n\n\n\n\nIn your \nproject.yml\n file you can specify different combinations of \nthe version number and stability value.  For example:\n\n\n\n\n0-latest\n      -- The latest version with major number 0\n\n\n1.2-stable\n    -- The latest stable version with major and minor number 1.2\n\n\n1.2-dev\n       -- The development version from 1.2\n\n\n1.1.1\n         -- a specific version 1.1.1\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot specify a stability string with a fully numbered version, e.g.\n\n\n1.2.8-stable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo Versions Available\n\n\nA \nrepository.yml\n file contains information to match a version request\ninto a git branch to fetch for your project.\n\n\nIt's up to the repository maintainer to map these to branches of the \nrepository.  For example, let's say in a fictitious repository the following are \ndefined.\n\n\nrepo.versions:\n    \"0.8.0\": \"xxx_branch_0_8_0\"\n    \"1.0.0\": \"xxx_branch_1_0_0\"\n    \"1.0.2\": \"xxx_branch_1_0_2\"\n    \"1.1.1\": \"xxx_branch_1_1_0\"\n    \"1.1.2\": \"xxx_branch_1_1_2\"\n    \"1.2.0\": \"xxx_branch_1_2_0\"\n    \"1.2.1\": \"xxx_branch_1_2_1\"\n    \"1.2-dev\": \"1.2.1\"\n    \"1-dev\": \"1.2-dev\"\n    \"1.2-stable\": \"1.2.0\"\n    \"0-latest\": \"0.8.0\"\n    \"1-latest\": \"1-dev\"\n    ....\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the \nproject.yml\n file asks for \n1.2-stable\n it is resolved to version\n\n1.2.0\n (perhaps \n1.2.1\n is not stable yet), which in turn resolves to a specific\nbranch \nxxx_branch_1_2_0\n.  This is the branch that \nnewt\n fetches into \nyour project. \n\n\nNote:\n Make sure a repo version exists in the \nrepository.yml\n file of a repo you wish to add. Otherwise Newt will not be able to resolve the version and will fail to fetch the repo into your project.\n\n\n\n\nHow to find out what Repos are available for Mynewt components\n\n\nCurrently, there is no \nnewt\n command to locate/search Mynewt package \nrepositories.  However, since the \nnewt\n tool supports only github, \nsearching github by keyword is a satisfactory option until a search \ntool is created.\n\n\nWhen searching github, recall that a Mynewt repository must \nhave a \nrepository.yml\n file in its root directory. If you don't see \nthat file, it's not a Mynewt repository and can't be included in your \nproject via the newt tool.  \n\n\nOnce you find a repository, the github URL and \nrepository.yml\n file\nshould give you all the information to add it to your \nproject.yml\n file.",

As an example, if the repository.yml file has the following content, it means there is one version of the apache-mynewt-core operating system available, which is \n0.0.0\n (implying we haven't released yet!). Such a version number corresponds to the \"develop\" branch in this repository. \n0-latest\n would also resolved to this same \n0.0.0\n version.

This is the name you in include in the \nproject.repositories\n variable when adding this repository to your project.\n\n\nrepo.versions\n A description of what versions to give the user depending \non the settings in their \nproject.yml\n file.  See below for a thorough description\non versioning. Its a flexible mapping between version numbers and git branches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo Version Specification\n\n\nThe version field argument for a repo has the following format:\n\n\n<major_num>.<minor_num>.<revision_num>\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n<major_num>.<minor_num>-<stability string>\n\n\n\n\n\nor \n\n\n<major_num>-<stability string>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stability string can be one of 3 pre-defined stability values.\n\n\n\n\nstable -- A stable release version of the repository\n\n\ndev    -- A development version from the repository\n\n\nlatest -- The latest from the repository\n\n\n\n\nIn your \nproject.yml\n file you can specify different combinations of \nthe version number and stability value.  For example:\n\n\n\n\n0-latest\n      -- The latest version with major number 0\n\n\n1.2-stable\n    -- The latest stable version with major and minor number 1.2\n\n\n1.2-dev\n       -- The development version from 1.2\n\n\n1.1.1\n         -- a specific version 1.1.1\n\n\n\n\nYou \ncannot\n specify a stability string with a fully numbered version, e.g.\n\n\n1.2.8-stable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo Version Resolution\n\n\nA \nrepository.yml\n file contains information to match this version request\ninto a git branch to fetch for your project.\n\n\nIt's up to you as the repository maintainer to map these to actual github branches of the repository.  For example, let's say in a fictitious repository the following are defined.\n\n\nrepo.versions:\n    \"0.8.0\": \"xxx_branch_0_8_0\"\n    \"1.0.0\": \"xxx_branch_1_0_0\"\n    \"1.0.2\": \"xxx_branch_1_0_2\"\n    \"1.1.1\": \"xxx_branch_1_1_0\"\n    \"1.1.2\": \"xxx_branch_1_1_2\"\n    \"1.2.0\": \"xxx_branch_1_2_0\"\n    \"1.2.1\": \"xxx_branch_1_2_1\"\n    \"1.2-dev\": \"1.2.1\"\n    \"1-dev\": \"1.2-dev\"\n    \"1.2-stable\": \"1.2.0\"\n    \"0-latest\": \"0.8.0\"\n    \"1-latest\": \"1-dev\"\n    ....\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the \nproject.yml\n file asks for \n1.2-stable\n it will be resolved to version\n\n1.2.0\n which in turn will resolve to a specific branch \nxxx_branch_1_2_0\n.  This is the branch that \nnewt\n will fetch into the project with that \nproject.yml\n file.\n\n\n\n\nDependencies on other repos\n\n\nRepositories can also have dependencies on other repositories.  These \ndependencies should be listed out on a per-tag basis.  So, for example, \nif apache-mynewt-core were to depend on sterlys-little-repo, you might \nhave the following directives in the repository.yml:\n\n\ndevelop.repositories:\n    sterlys-little-repo:\n        type: github\n        vers: 0.8-latest\n        user: sterlinghughes\n        repo: sterlys-little-repo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would tell Newt that for anything that resolves to the develop \nbranch, this repository requires the sterlys-little-repo repository. \n\n\nDependencies are resolved circularly by the newt tool, and every dependent repository is placed as a sibling in the repos directory. Currently, if two repositories have the same name, they will conflict and bad things will happen.\n\n\nWhen a repository is installed to the repos/ directory, the current \nversion of that repository is written to the \"project.state\" file.  The \nproject state file contains the currently installed version of any given \nrepository.  This way, the current set of repositories can be recreated \nfrom the project.state file reliably, whereas the project.yml file can \nhave higher level directives (i.e. include 0.8-stable.)\n\n\nResolving dependencies\n\n\nAt the moment, all dependencies must match, otherwise newt will provide \nan error.  As an example, if you have a set of dependencies such that:\n\n\napache-mynewt-core depends on sterlys-little-repo 0.6-stable\napache-mynewt-core depends on sterlys-big-repo 0.5.1\nsterlys-big-repo-0.5.1 depends on sterlys-little-repo 0.6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere 0.6-stable is 0.6.3, the newt tool will try and resolve the dependency to \nsterlys-little-repo.  It will notice that there are two conflicting \nversions of the same repository, and not perform installation.\n\n\nIn the future Newt will be smarter about loading in all dependencies, \nand then looking to satisfy those dependencies to the best match of all \npotential options.",

You know you need the board support package for that hardware. You can look up its location, add it your project, and fetch that along with the core OS components.\n\n\nTo make this happen, you'll need to modify the project.yml in your project's root directory.\n\n\n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ emacs project.yml &\n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cat project.yml\n    project.name: \"air_quality\"\n\n    project.repositories:\n        - apache-mynewt-core\n        - mynewt_stm32f3\n\n    # Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries.\n    # This provides mirroring automatically for us.\n    #\n    repository.apache-mynewt-core:\n        type: github\n        vers: 0-latest\n        user: apache\n        repo: incubator-mynewt-core\n\n    repository.mynewt_stm32f3:\n        type: github\n        vers: 0-latest\n        user: runtimeinc\n        repo: mynewt_stm32f3\n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt install\n    apache-mynewt-core\n    mynewt_stm32f3\n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ ls repos/\n    apache-mynewt-core  mynewt_stm32f3\n\n\n\n\n\nGood.

Your original BSP, hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery, has only one UART set up (as specified in src/hal_bsp.c, include/hal/bsp.h). Therefore, you need to create your own bsp which has configuration for this added hardware.\n\n\nSo in the shell you make a copy of the original BSP, and then change the package file a little.\n\n\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir hw\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir hw/bsp\n\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cp -R repos/mynewt_stm32f3/hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you modify the pkg.yml in the copied BSP to assign name for this package. And modify the dependency for MCU package to point to mynewt_stm32f3 repository.\n\n\n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ grep pkg.name hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair/pkg.yml\n    pkg.name: \"hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair\"\n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ tail -2 hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair/pkg.yml\npkg.deps:\n    - \"@mynewt_stm32f3/hw/mcu/stm/stm32f3xx\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you want to use this BSP with my target. So you change the BSP in the target definition.\n\n\nHere's your new target.\n\n\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target show air_q\ntargets/air_q\n    app=apps/air_quality\n    bsp=hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair\n    build_profile=debug\n\n\n\n\n\nYou add the 2nd serial port to my new BSP. Go to hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair directory to do this.\n\n\nModify the include/hal/bsp.h to increase UART_CNT to 2, and add a definition of the 2nd logical UART. You will use this in your sensor driver.\n\n\nstatic\n \nconst\n \nstruct\n \nstm32f3_uart_cfg\n \nuart_cfg\n[\nUART_CNT\n] \n=\n {\n    [\n0\n] \n=\n {\n        .\nsuc_uart\n \n=\n \nUSART1\n,\n        .\nsuc_rcc_cmd\n \n=\n \nRCC_APB2PeriphClockCmd\n,\n        .\nsuc_rcc_dev\n \n=\n \nRCC_APB2Periph_USART1\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_tx\n \n=\n \n9\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_rx\n \n=\n \n10\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_rts\n \n=\n \n12\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_cts\n \n=\n \n11\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_af\n \n=\n \nGPIO_AF_7\n,\n        .\nsuc_irqn\n \n=\n \nUSART1_IRQn\n\n    },\n    [\n1\n] \n=\n {\n        .\nsuc_uart\n \n=\n \nUSART2\n,\n        .\nsuc_rcc_cmd\n \n=\n \nRCC_APB1PeriphClockCmd\n,\n        .\nsuc_rcc_dev\n \n=\n \nRCC_APB1Periph_USART2\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_tx\n \n=\n \n19\n, \n/* PB3 */\n\n        .\nsuc_pin_rx\n \n=\n \n20\n, \n/* PB4 */\n\n        .\nsuc_pin_rts\n \n=\n \n1\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_cts\n \n=\n \n0\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_af\n \n=\n \nGPIO_AF_7\n,\n        .\nsuc_irqn\n \n=\n \nUSART2_IRQn\n\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this in place, you can refer to serial port where your SenseAir sensor is by a logical number. This makes the code more platform independent - you could connect this sensor to another board, like Olimex. You will also use the HAL UART abstraction to do the UART port setup and data transfer. That way you don't need to have any platform dependent pieces within your little driver.\n\n\nYou will now see what the driver code ends up looking like. Here's the header file, filled in from stub you created earlier.\n\n\n/*\n\n\n * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n\n\n * or more contributor license agreements.

This makes the code more platform independent - you could connect this sensor to another board, like Olimex. You will also use the HAL UART abstraction to do the UART port setup and data transfer. That way you don't need to have any platform dependent pieces within your little driver.  You will now see what the driver code ends up looking like.

            "text": "How to define a task which uses event queues to manage multiple events\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nEvent queue is a mechanism by which you can serialize incoming events for your task. You can use it to get info about arrived hardware interrupts, callout expirations and messages from other tasks.\n\n\nThe benefit of doing inter-task communication this way is that there should be less resources that need to be locked.\n\n\nThe benefit of doing interrupt processing in a task context instead of inside an interrupt context is that you are not blocking other HW interrupts when doing the work. The same goes for high priority tasks in the system; they're blocked until the interrupt handler returns. From the task context you'll also be able to access other OS facilities; you can sleep while waiting for a lock, for example.\n\n\n\n\nExample app\n\n\nHere you are going to write an app which demonstrates the use of event queues for communication between tasks. You will  also use OS callouts for timer expiration and another event from a GPIO interrupt.\n\n\nYou will  use inputs from 3 sources to toggle 3 GPIO outputs on my STM32F3discovery board.\n\n\n\n\nCreate project\n\n\nYou start by creating a project and populating it with repositories incubator-mynewt-core and mynewt_stm32f3. See \nSTM32F3 tutorial\n if you need help with this. You can also read the tutorial on \nAdditional Repositories\n for a more thorough understanding. \n\n\n \n\n\nCreate application\n\n\nHere's what the pkg.yml looks for the application.\n\n\n[marko@IsMyLaptop:~/src/events]$ cat apps/event_sample/pkg.yml\npkg.name: apps/event_sample\npkg.type: app\n\npkg.deps:\n    - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/os\"\n    - \"@apache-mynewt-core/hw/hal\"\n    - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/console/stub\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialize the event queue structure\n\n\nThis must be done before anyone tries to place events to the queue. Here it's done before any task gets created. Initialization is done by calling \nos_eventq_init()\n.\n\n\n#define MY_TASK_PRIO        4\n\n\n#define MY_TASK_STACK_SZ    512\n\n\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_eventq\n \nmy_eventq\n;\n\nstatic\n \nos_stack_t\n \nmy_task_stack\n[\nMY_TASK_STACK_SZ\n];\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \nmy_task_str\n;\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ninit_tasks\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \ntaskid\n;\n\n    \nos_eventq_init\n(\n&my_eventq\n);\n    \nos_task_init\n(\n&my_task_str\n, \n\"task\"\n, \nmy_task\n, \nNULL\n, \nMY_TASK_PRIO\n,\n        \nOS_WAIT_FOREVER\n, \nmy_task_stack\n, \nMY_TASK_STACK_SZ\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing events\n\n\nHere event processing is done inside \nmy_task\n. The main loop of the task is pulling events from the queue, and then taking action. We look at the type of the event to figure out what to do.\n\n\nThe code snippet shows what the main loop of the event handler looks like. Events are removed from the head of the queue using os_eventq_get\n\n\nvoid\n\n\nmy_task\n(\nvoid\n \n*arg\n)\n{\n    \nstruct\n \nos_event\n \n*ev\n;\n\n    \nwhile\n (\n1\n) {\n        \nev\n \n=\n \nos_eventq_get\n(\n&my_eventq\n);\n        \nswitch\n (\nev->ev_type\n) {\n        \n/* more event types here */\n\n        \ndefault\n:\n\n            \nassert\n(\n0\n);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent types\n\n\nYou can define your own event types. Some numbers are already reserved by the OS, so you should not use those as your own types.\n\n\nReserved event types are defined in \nlibs/os/include/os/os_eventq.h\n. One example of a reserved type is OS_EVENT_T_TIMER, which is used as type in OS callouts.\n\n\nYou should start your event numbers from \nOS_EVENT_T_PERUSER\n, and go higher.\n\n\nYou are going to generate events from GPIO interrupt handler, from another task as well as from a callout. OS callout already has a type, but you'll need to define types for the other uses.\n\n\n#define MY_TASK_GPIO_EVENT  (OS_EVENT_T_PERUSER)\n\n\n#define MY_TASK_TASK_EVENT  (OS_EVENT_T_PERUSER + 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosting events from another task\n\n\nEvents are posted to a queue by calling \nos_eventq_put()\n. You need to preallocate memory for the event structure. Here it's done by declaring the event structure as a global variable.\n\n\nNote that you can call \nos_eventq_put()\n with an event which has already been queued. In that case, the call has no effect; the position of the event is not changed within the queue.\n\n\nIn the code snippet we declare the os_event structure, and initialize it. We also create the event generating task, and periodically post event to the event queue.\n\n\n#define GEN_TASK_PRIO       3\n\n\n#define GEN_TASK_STACK_SZ   512\n\n\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_event\n \ngen_task_ev\n;\n\nstatic\n \nos_stack_t\n \ngen_task_stack\n[\nGEN_TASK_STACK_SZ\n];\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \ngen_task_str\n;\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ngen_task\n(\nvoid\n \n*arg\n)\n{\n    \nwhile\n (\n1\n) {\n        \nos_time_delay\n(\nOS_TICKS_PER_SEC\n \n/\n \n4\n);\n        \nos_eventq_put\n(\n&my_eventq\n, \n&gen_task_ev\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ninit_tasks\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \n/* .... */\n\n    \ngen_task_ev\n.\nev_type\n \n=\n \nMY_TASK_TASK_EVENT\n;\n    \nos_task_init\n(\n&gen_task_str\n, \n\"gen_task\"\n, \ngen_task\n, \nNULL\n, \nGEN_TASK_PRIO\n,\n        \nOS_WAIT_FOREVER\n, \ngen_task_stack\n, \nGEN_TASK_STACK_SZ\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout events\n\n\nYou can get timer events delivered to your task's event queue with OS callout. Check \ncallout documentation\n for description on how to use the API.\n\n\nFor this example, you'll use only one type of callout; so you can use the simpler structure.\n\n\nIn the code snippet we declare the os_callout structure and initialize it. Then we arm the timer.\n\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_callout\n \nmy_callout\n;\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ninit_tasks\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \n/* .... */\n\n\n    \nos_callout_init\n(\n&my_callout\n, \n&my_eventq\n, \nNULL\n);\n    \nos_callout_reset\n(\n&my_callout\n, \nOS_TICKS_PER_SEC\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosting events from interrupt handler\n\n\nAnother place where posting events makes sense is from an interrupt handler. In this tutorial you will do it when GPIO changes state.\n\n\nYou'll use HAL GPIO interface to register a routine which is getting called from the interrupt handler context. This routine will then post event to your queue.\n\n\nOn STM32F3Discovery board, there is a button connected to PA0. The identifier for this GPIO pin is 0.\n\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_event\n \ngpio_ev\n;\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ninit_tasks\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \n/* .... */\n\n\n    \ngpio_ev\n.\nev_type\n \n=\n \nMY_TASK_GPIO_EVENT\n;\n    \nhal_gpio_irq_init\n(\n0\n, \nmy_gpio_irq\n, \nNULL\n, \nGPIO_TRIG_RISING\n,\n        \nGPIO_PULL_NONE\n);\n    \nhal_gpio_irq_enable\n(\n0\n);\n}\n\n\nstatic\n \nvoid\n\n\nmy_gpio_irq\n(\nvoid\n \n*arg\n)\n{\n    \nos_eventq_put\n(\n&my_eventq\n, \n&gpio_ev\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent processing finalized\n\n\nNow that you are posting events from different sources, you will fill in the parts in the task main loop to trigger different behaviors depending on event type.\n\n\nYou'll drive different LEDs depending on what type of event arrived. LEDs on this board are connected to PE8, PE9, PE10 and so on.

You can use it to get info about arrived hardware interrupts, callout expirations and messages from other tasks.  The benefit of doing inter-task communication this way is that there should be less resources that need to be locked.  The benefit of doing interrupt processing in a task context instead of inside an interrupt context is that you are not blocking other HW interrupts when doing the work. The same goes for high priority tasks in the system; they're blocked until the interrupt handler returns. From the task context you'll also be able to access other OS facilities; you can sleep while waiting for a lock, for example.",

You will need to open a new console (or execute this in another console) to continue the tutorial.*\n\n\n\n\nSetting up a connection profile\n\n\nYou will now set up a connection profile using \nnewtmgr\n for the serial port connection and start communicating with the simulated remote device.\n\n\n    $ newtmgr conn add sim1 type=serial connstring=/dev/ttys005\n    Connection profile sim1 successfully added\n    $ newtmgr conn show\n    Connection profiles: \n      sim1: type=serial, connstring='/dev/ttys007'\n\n\n\n\n\nExecuting newtmgr commands with the target\n\n\nYou can now use connection profile \nsim1\n to talk to the running sim_blinky.\nAs an example, we will query the running mynewt OS for the usage of its \nmemory pools.  \n\n\n    $ newtmgr -c sim1 mpstats\n    Return Code = 0\n      nffs_cache_inode_pool (blksize=36 nblocks=4 nfree=4)\n      nffs_cache_block_pool (blksize=32 nblocks=64 nfree=64)\n      nffs_dir_pool (blksize=8 nblocks=4 nfree=4)\n      default_mbuf_data (blksize=256 nblocks=10 nfree=8)\n      nffs_file_pool (blksize=12 nblocks=4 nfree=4)\n      nffs_inode_entry_pool (blksize=24 nblocks=100 nfree=98)\n      nffs_block_entry_pool (blksize=12 nblocks=100 nfree=100)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a test command, you can send an arbitrary string to the target and it\nwill echo that string back in a response to newtmgr.\n\n\n    $ newtmgr -c sim1 echo \"Hello Mynewt\"\n    {\"r\": \"Hello Mynewt\"}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response comes back as a json string.\n\n\nIn addition to these, you can also examine running tasks, statistics, \nlogs, image status (not on sim), and configuration.",

You should see the green LED blinking. If not, try powercycling the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have to set up the serial connection from your computer to the Olimex board. Locate the PC6/USART6_TX (pin#3), PC7/USART6_RX (pin#4), and GND (pin#2) of the UEXT connector on the Olimex board. More information on the UEXT connector can be found at \nhttps://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/UEXT/\n. The schematic of the board can be found at \nhttps://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/resources/STM32-E407_sch.pdf\n for reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the female RX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the TX of the UEXT connector on the board. \n\n\nConnect the female TX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the RX of the UEXT connector on the board. \n\n\nConnect the GND pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the GND of the UEXT connector on the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate the serial connection established in the /dev directory of your computer. It should be of the type \ntty.usbserial-<some identifier>\n.\n\n\n\n\n        $ ls /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ \n        /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou now have to define a connection profile using newtmgr. You can give it any name you want. The example below shows the connection profile being named as the very imaginative \nolimex01\n.\n\n\n\n\n        $ pwd\n        /Users/<user>/dev/larva/project/slinky\n        $ newtmgr conn add olimex01 type=serial connstring=/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ \n        Connection profile olimex01 successfully added\n        $ newtmgr conn show\n        Connection profiles: \n          sim1: type=serial, connstring='/dev/ttys007'\n          olimex01: type=serial, connstring='/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go ahead and query the Olimex board to get responses back. The simplest command is the \necho\n command to ask it to respond with the text you send it. \n\n\n\n\n    $ newtmgr echo -c olimex01 hello\n    {\"r\": \"hello\"}\n    $ newtmgr image -c olimex01 list\n    Images:\n        0 : 1.2.3\n    $ newtmgr -c olimex01 taskstats\n    Return Code = 0\n      newtmgr (prio=4 tid=2 runtime=0 cswcnt=12 stksize=512 stkusage=255 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n      task1 (prio=1 tid=3 runtime=0 cswcnt=299 stksize=128 stkusage=33 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n      task2 (prio=2 tid=4 runtime=0 cswcnt=300 stksize=128 stkusage=31 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n      idle (prio=255 tid=0 runtime=299916 cswcnt=313 stksize=32 stkusage=18 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n      shell (prio=3 tid=1 runtime=1 cswcnt=20 stksize=384 stkusage=60 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)",

Next go the to project directory and download the slinky project image to the flash of the Olimex board.     $ newt load stm32_bootloader\n$ newt load stm32_slinky  You can now disconnect the debugging cable from the board. You should see the green LED blinking. If not, try powercycling the board.     Now you have to set up the serial connection from your computer to the Olimex board. Locate the PC6/USART6_TX (pin#3), PC7/USART6_RX (pin#4), and GND (pin#2) of the UEXT connector on the Olimex board. More information on the UEXT connector can be found at  https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/UEXT/ . The schematic of the board can be found at  https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/resources/STM32-E407_sch.pdf  for reference.    Connect the female RX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the TX of the UEXT connector on the board.   Connect the female TX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the RX of the UEXT connector on the board.   Connect the GND pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the GND of the UEXT connector on the board.       Locate the serial connection established in the /dev directory of your computer. It should be of the type  tty.usbserial-<some identifier> .           $ ls /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ \n        /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ    You now have to define a connection profile using newtmgr. You can give it any name you want. The example below shows the connection profile being named as the very imaginative  olimex01 .           $ pwd\n        /Users/<user>/dev/larva/project/slinky\n        $ newtmgr conn add olimex01 type=serial connstring=/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ \n        Connection profile olimex01 successfully added\n        $ newtmgr conn show\n        Connection profiles: \n          sim1: type=serial, connstring='/dev/ttys007'\n          olimex01: type=serial, connstring='/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ'    Now go ahead and query the Olimex board to get responses back. The simplest command is the  echo  command to ask it to respond with the text you send it.        $ newtmgr echo -c olimex01 hello\n    {\"r\": \"hello\"}\n    $ newtmgr image -c olimex01 list\n    Images:\n        0 : 1.2.3\n    $ newtmgr -c olimex01 taskstats\n    Return Code = 0\n      newtmgr (prio=4 tid=2 runtime=0 cswcnt=12 stksize=512 stkusage=255 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n      task1 (prio=1 tid=3 runtime=0 cswcnt=299 stksize=128 stkusage=33 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n      task2 (prio=2 tid=4 runtime=0 cswcnt=300 stksize=128 stkusage=31 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n      idle (prio=255 tid=0 runtime=299916 cswcnt=313 stksize=32 stkusage=18 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n      shell (prio=3 tid=1 runtime=1 cswcnt=20 stksize=384 stkusage=60 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)",

This conversion function returns the corresponding\n16-bit UUID on success, or 0 on failure.

The\n\nassert()\n here is another case of making sure the NimBLE stack is doing its\njob; this characteristic was registered as read-only, so the stack should have\nprevented write accesses.\n\n\nTo fulfill a characteristic read request, the application needs to assign the\n\nctxt->chr_access.data\n field to point to the attribute data to respond with,\nand fill the \nctxt->chr_access.len\n field with the length of the attribute data.\n\nbleprph\n stores the device name in read-only memory as follows:\n\n\n\n\nconst\n \nchar\n \n*bleprph_device_name\n \n=\n \n\"nimble-bleprph\"\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cast to pointer-to-void is a necessary annoyance to remove the \nconst\n\nqualifier from the device name variable.

In other words, you must not\nallocate the characteristic value data on the stack of the access function.\nTwo characteristic accesses never occur at the same time, so it is OK to use\nthe same memory for repeated accesses.\n\n\n\n\nWrite access\n\n\n\n\n    \ncase\n \nBLE_GAP_CHR_UUID16_RECONNECT_ADDR\n:\n        \nassert\n(\nop\n \n==\n \nBLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_WRITE_CHR\n);\n        \nif\n (\nctxt->chr_access\n.\nlen\n \n!=\n \nsizeof\n \nbleprph_reconnect_addr\n) {\n            \nreturn\n \nBLE_ATT_ERR_INVALID_ATTR_VALUE_LEN\n;\n        }\n        \nmemcpy\n(\nbleprph_reconnect_addr\n, \nctxt->chr_access\n.\ndata\n,\n               \nsizeof\n \nbleprph_reconnect_addr\n);\n        \nbreak\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code excerpt handles writes to the reconnect address characteristic.  This\ncharacteristic was registered as write-only, so the \nassert()\n here is just a\nsafety precaution to ensure the NimBLE stack is doing its job.\n\n\nFor writes, the roles of the \nctxt->chr_access.data\n and \nctxt->chr_access.len\n\nfields are the reverse of the read case.  The NimBLE stack uses these fields to\nindicate the data written by the peer.\n\n\nMany characteristics have strict length requirements for write operations.\nThis characteristic has such a restriction; if the written data is not a 48-bit\nBR address, the application tells NimBLE to respond with an invalid attribute\nvalue length error.\n\n\nFor writes, the \nctxt->chr_access.data\n pointer is only valid for the duration\nof the access function.

A\nconnection callback is a bit of application code which NimBLE uses to inform\nyou of connection-related events.  For example, if a connection is terminated,\nNimBLE lets you know about it with a call to that connection's callback.  In the  advertising section  of this tutorial, we saw how the\napplication specifies a connection callback when it begins advertising.  NimBLE\nuses this callback to notify the application that a central has connected to\nyour peripheral after receiving an advertisement.  Let's revisit how  bleprph  specifies its connection callback when advertising:        /* Begin advertising. */ \n     rc   =   ble_gap_adv_start ( BLE_GAP_DISC_MODE_GEN ,  BLE_GAP_CONN_MODE_UND ,\n                            NULL ,  0 ,  NULL ,  bleprph_on_connect ,  NULL );\n     if  ( rc   !=   0 ) {\n         BLEPRPH_LOG ( ERROR ,  \"error enabling advertisement; rc=%d\\n\" ,  rc );\n         return ;\n    }",

            "text": "The  bleprph_on_connect()  function is  bleprph 's connection callback; NimBLE\ncalls this function when the advertising operation leads to connection\nestablishment.  Upon connecting, this callback becomes permanently associated\nwith the connection; all subsequent events related to this connection are\ncommunicated through this callback.  Now let's look at the function that  bleprph  uses for all its connection\ncallbacks:  bleprph_on_connect() .  static   int  bleprph_on_connect ( int   event ,  int   status ,  struct   ble_gap_conn_ctxt   *ctxt ,\n                    void   *arg )\n{\n     switch  ( event ) {\n     case   BLE_GAP_EVENT_CONN :\n         BLEPRPH_LOG ( INFO ,  \"connection %s; status=%d \" ,\n                     status   ==   0   ?   \"up\"   :   \"down\" ,  status );\n         bleprph_print_conn_desc ( ctxt->desc );\n         BLEPRPH_LOG ( INFO ,  \"\\n\" );\n\n         if  ( status   !=   0 ) {\n             /* Connection terminated; resume advertising. */ \n             bleprph_advertise ();\n        }\n         break ;\n    }\n\n     return   0 ;\n}   Connection callbacks are used to communicate a variety of events related to a\nconnection.  An application determines the type of event that occurred by\ninspecting the value of the  event  parameter.  The full list of event codes\ncan be found in  net/nimble/host/include/host/ble_gatt.h . bleprph  only concerns itself with a single event type:  BLE_GAP_EVENT_CONN .\nThis event indicates that a new connection has been established, or an existing\nconnection has been terminated; the  status  parameter clarifies which.  As you\ncan see,  bleprph  uses the  status  parameter to determine if it should resume\nadvertising.  The  ctxt  parameter contains additional information about the connection\nevent.   bleprph  does nothing more than log some fields of this struct, but\nsome apps will likely want to perform further actions, e.g., perform service\ndiscovery on the connected device.  The  struct ble_gap_conn_ctxt  type is\ndefined as follows:  struct   ble_gap_conn_ctxt  {\n     struct   ble_gap_conn_desc   *desc ;\n\n     union  {\n         struct  {\n             struct   ble_gap_upd_params   *self_params ;\n             struct   ble_gap_upd_params   *peer_params ;\n        }  update ;\n\n         struct   ble_gap_sec_params   *sec_params ;\n    };\n};   As shown, a connection context object consists of two parts:   desc:  The connection descriptor; indicates properties of the connection.  anonymous union:  The contents are event-specific; check the  event  code to determine which member field (if any) is relevant.   For events of type  BLE_GAP_EVENT_CONN , the anonymous union is not used at all, so the only information carried by the context struct is the connection descriptor.  The  struct ble_gap_conn_desc  type is defined as follows:  struct   ble_gap_conn_desc  {\n     uint8_t   peer_addr [ 6 ];\n     uint16_t   conn_handle ;\n     uint16_t   conn_itvl ;\n     uint16_t   conn_latency ;\n     uint16_t   supervision_timeout ;\n     uint8_t   peer_addr_type ;\n};   We will examine these fields in a slightly different order from how they appear\nin the struct definition.

Each of these features is described in detail in its own section of the manual.\n\n\nA multitasking, preemptive operating system is one in which a number of different tasks can be instantiated and assigned a priority, with higher priority tasks running before lower priority tasks. Furthermore, if a lower priority task is running and a higher priority task wants to run, the lower priority task is halted and the higher priority task is allowed to run. In other words, the lower priority task is preempted by the higher priority task.\n\n\nWhy use an OS?\n\n\nYou may ask yourself \"why do I need a multitasking preemptive OS\"? The answer may indeed be that you do not. Some applications are simple and only require a polling loop. Others are more complex and may require that certain jobs are executed in a timely manner or before other jobs are executed. If you have a simple polling loop, you cannot move on to service a job until the current job is done being serviced. With the Mynewt OS, the application developer need not worry about certain jobs taking too long or not executing in a timely fashion; the OS provides mechanisms to deal with these situations. Another benefit of using an OS is that it helps shield application developers from other application code being written; the developer does not have to worry (or has to worry less) about other application code behaving badly and causing undesirable behavior or preventing their code from executing properly. Other benefits of using an OS (and the Mynewt OS in particular) is that it also provides features that the developer would otherwise need to create on his/her own. \n\n\nCore OS Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheduler/context switching\n\n\nTime\n\n\nTasks\n\n\nEvent queues/callouts\n\n\nSemaphores\n\n\nMutexes\n\n\nMemory pools\n\n\nHeap\n\n\nMbufs\n\n\nSanity\n\n\nCallouts\n\n\nPorting OS to other platforms\n\n\n\n\nBasic OS Application Creation\n\n\nCreating an application using the Mynewt Core OS is a relatively simple task: once you have installed the basic Newt Tool structure (build structure) for your application and created your BSP (Board Support Package), the developer initializes the OS by calling \nos_init()\n, performs application specific initializations, and then starts the os by calling \nos_start()\n. \n\n\nThe \nos_init()\n API performs two basic functions: calls architecture and bsp specific setup and initializes the idle task of the OS. This is required before the OS is started. The OS start API initializes the OS time tick interrupt and starts the highest priority task running (i.e starts the scheduler). Note that \nos_start()\n never returns; once called the device is either running in an application task context or in idle task context.\n\n\nInitializing application modules and tasks can get somewhat complicated with RTOS's similar to Mynewt. Care must be taken that the API provided by a task are initialized prior to being called by another (higher priority) task. \n\n\nFor example, take a simple application with two tasks (tasks 1 and 2, with task 1 higher priority than task 2). Task 2 provides an API which has a semaphore lock and this semaphore is initialized by task 2 when the task handler for task 2 is called. Task 1 is expected to call this API.\n\n\nConsider the sequence of events when the OS is started. The scheduler starts running and picks the highest priority task (task 1 in this case). The task handler function for task 1 is called and will keep running until it yields execution. Before yielding, code in the task 1 handler function calls the API provided by task 2. The semaphore being accessed in the task 2 API has yet to be initialized since the task 2 handler function has not had a chance to run! This will lead to undesirable behavior and will need to be addressed by the application developer. Note that the Mynewt OS does guard against internal API being called before the OS has started (they will return error) but it does not safeguard application defined objects from access prior to initialization.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nOne way to avoid initialization issues like the one described above is to perform task initializations prior to starting the OS. The code example shown below illustrates this concept. The application initializes the OS, calls an application specific \"task initialization\" function, and then starts the OS. The application task initialization function is responsible for initializing all the data objects that each task exposes to the other tasks. The tasks themselves are also initialized at this time (by calling \nos_task_init()\n). \n\n\nIn the example, each task works in a ping-pong like fashion: task 1 wakes up, adds a token to semaphore 1 and then waits for a token from semaphore 2. Task 2 waits for a token on semaphore 1 and once it gets it, adds a token to semaphore 2. Notice that the semaphores are initialized by the application specific task initialization functions and not inside the task handler functions. If task 2 (being lower in priority than task 1) had called os_sem_init() for task2_sem inside task2_handler(), task 1 would have called os_sem_pend() using task2_sem before task2_sem was initialized.\n\n\n/* Task 1 handler function */\nvoid\ntask1_handler(void *arg)\n{\n    while (1) {\n        /* Release semaphore to task 2 */\n        os_sem_release(&task1_sem);\n\n        /* Wait for semaphore from task 2 */\n        os_sem_pend(&task2_sem, OS_TIMEOUT_NEVER);\n    }\n}\n\n/* Task 2 handler function */\nvoid\ntask2_handler(void *arg)\n{\n    struct os_task *t;\n\n    while (1) {\n        /* Wait for semaphore from task1 */\n        os_sem_pend(&task1_sem, OS_TIMEOUT_NEVER);\n\n        /* Release task2 semaphore */\n        os_sem_release(&task2_sem);\n    }\n}\n\n\n/* Initialize task 1 exposed data objects */\nvoid\ntask1_init(void)\n{\n    /* Initialize task1 semaphore */\n    os_sem_init(&task1_sem, 0);\n}\n\n/* Initialize task 2 exposed data objects */\nvoid\ntask2_init(void)\n{\n    /* Initialize task1 semaphore */\n    os_sem_init(&task2_sem, 0);\n}\n\n/**\n * init_app_tasks\n *  \n * Called by main.c after os_init().

Care must be taken that the API provided by a task are initialized prior to being called by another (higher priority) task.   For example, take a simple application with two tasks (tasks 1 and 2, with task 1 higher priority than task 2). Task 2 provides an API which has a semaphore lock and this semaphore is initialized by task 2 when the task handler for task 2 is called. Task 1 is expected to call this API.  Consider the sequence of events when the OS is started. The scheduler starts running and picks the highest priority task (task 1 in this case). The task handler function for task 1 is called and will keep running until it yields execution. Before yielding, code in the task 1 handler function calls the API provided by task 2. The semaphore being accessed in the task 2 API has yet to be initialized since the task 2 handler function has not had a chance to run! This will lead to undesirable behavior and will need to be addressed by the application developer. Note that the Mynewt OS does guard against internal API being called before the OS has started (they will return error) but it does not safeguard application defined objects from access prior to initialization.",

            "text": "One way to avoid initialization issues like the one described above is to perform task initializations prior to starting the OS. The code example shown below illustrates this concept. The application initializes the OS, calls an application specific \"task initialization\" function, and then starts the OS. The application task initialization function is responsible for initializing all the data objects that each task exposes to the other tasks. The tasks themselves are also initialized at this time (by calling  os_task_init() ).   In the example, each task works in a ping-pong like fashion: task 1 wakes up, adds a token to semaphore 1 and then waits for a token from semaphore 2. Task 2 waits for a token on semaphore 1 and once it gets it, adds a token to semaphore 2. Notice that the semaphores are initialized by the application specific task initialization functions and not inside the task handler functions. If task 2 (being lower in priority than task 1) had called os_sem_init() for task2_sem inside task2_handler(), task 1 would have called os_sem_pend() using task2_sem before task2_sem was initialized.  /* Task 1 handler function */\nvoid\ntask1_handler(void *arg)\n{\n    while (1) {\n        /* Release semaphore to task 2 */\n        os_sem_release(&task1_sem);\n\n        /* Wait for semaphore from task 2 */\n        os_sem_pend(&task2_sem, OS_TIMEOUT_NEVER);\n    }\n}\n\n/* Task 2 handler function */\nvoid\ntask2_handler(void *arg)\n{\n    struct os_task *t;\n\n    while (1) {\n        /* Wait for semaphore from task1 */\n        os_sem_pend(&task1_sem, OS_TIMEOUT_NEVER);\n\n        /* Release task2 semaphore */\n        os_sem_release(&task2_sem);\n    }\n}\n\n\n/* Initialize task 1 exposed data objects */\nvoid\ntask1_init(void)\n{\n    /* Initialize task1 semaphore */\n    os_sem_init(&task1_sem, 0);\n}\n\n/* Initialize task 2 exposed data objects */\nvoid\ntask2_init(void)\n{\n    /* Initialize task1 semaphore */\n    os_sem_init(&task2_sem, 0);\n}\n\n/**\n * init_app_tasks\n *  \n * Called by main.c after os_init().

The task \nfunction is basically a forever loop, waiting for some \"event\" to wake it up. \nThere are two methods used to signal a task that it has work to do: event queues \nand semaphores (see the appropriate manual sections for descriptions of these \nfeatures).\n\n\nThe Mynewt OS is a multi-tasking, preemptive OS. Every task is assigned a task \npriority (from 0 to 255), with 0 being the highest priority task. If a higher \npriority task than the current task wants to run, the scheduler preempts the \ncurrently running task and switches context to the higher priority task. This is \njust a fancy way of saying that the processor stack pointer now points to the \nstack of the higher priority task and the task resumes execution where it left \noff.\n\n\nTasks run to completion unless they are preempted by a higher priority task. The \ndeveloper must insure that tasks eventually \"sleep\"; otherwise lower priority \ntasks will never get a chance to run (actually, any task lower in priority than \nthe task that never sleeps). A task will be put to sleep in the following cases: \nit puts itself to sleep using \nos_time_delay()\n, it waits on an event queue \nwhich is empty or attempts to obtain a mutex or a semaphore that is currently \nowned by another task.\n\n\nNote that other sections of the manual describe these OS features in more \ndetail.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nIn order to create a task two data structures need to be defined: the task \nobject (struct os_task) and its associated stack. Determining the stack size can \nbe a bit tricky; generally developers should not declare large local variables \non the stack so that task stacks can be of limited size. However, all \napplications are different and the developer must choose the stack size \naccordingly. NOTE: be careful when declaring your stack! The stack is in units \nof \nos_stack_t\n sized elements (generally 32-bits). Looking at the example given \nbelow and assuming \nos_stack_t\n is defined to be a 32-bit unsigned value, \n\"my_task_stack\" will use 256 bytes. \n\n\nA task must also have an associated \"task function\". This is the function that \nwill be called when the task is first run. This task function should never \nreturn!\n\n\nIn order to inform the Mynewt OS of the new task and to have it added to the \nscheduler, the \nos_task_init()\n function is called. Once \nos_task_init()\n is \ncalled, the task is made ready to run and is added to the active task list. Note \nthat a task can be initialized (started) before or after the os has started \n(i.e. before \nos_start()\n is called) but must be initialized after the os has \nbeen initialized (i.e. 'os_init' has been called). In most of the examples and \ncurrent Mynewt projects, the os is initialized, tasks are initialized, and the \nthe os is started. Once the os has started, the highest priority task will be \nthe first task set to run.\n\n\nInformation about a task can be obtained using the \nos_task_info_get_next()\n \nAPI. Developers can walk the list of tasks to obtain information on all created \ntasks. This information is of type \nos_task_info\n and is described below.\n\n\nThe following is a very simple example showing a single application task.

            "text": "Semaphore\n\n\nA semaphore is a structure used for gaining exclusive access (much like a mutex), synchronizing task operations and/or use in a \"producer/consumer\" roles. Semaphores like the ones used by the myNewt OS are called \"counting\" semaphores as they are allowed to have more than one token (explained below).\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nA semaphore is a fairly simple construct consisting of a queue for waiting tasks and the number of tokens currently owned by the semaphore. A semaphore can be obtained as long as there are tokens in the semaphore. Any task can add tokens to the semaphore and any task can request the semaphore, thereby removing tokens. When creating the semaphore, the initial number of tokens can be set as well.\n\n\nWhen used for exclusive access to a shared resource the semaphore only needs a single token. In this case, a single task \"creates\" the semaphore by calling \nos_sem_init\n with a value of one (1) for the token. When a task desires exclusive access to the shared resource it requests the semaphore by calling \nos_sem_pend\n. If there is a token the requesting task will acquire the semaphore and continue operation. If no tokens are available the task will be put to sleep until there is a token. A common \"problem\" with using a semaphore for exclusive access is called \npriority inversion\n. Consider the following scenario: a high and low priority task both share a resource which is locked using a semaphore. If the low priority task obtains the semaphore and then the high priority task requests the semaphore, the high priority task is now blocked until the low priority task releases the semaphore. Now suppose that there are tasks between the low priority task and the high priority task that want to run. These tasks will preempt the low priority task which owns the semaphore. Thus, the high priority task is blocked waiting for the low priority task to finish using the semaphore but the low priority task cannot run since other tasks are running. Thus, the high priority tasks is \"inverted\" in priority; in effect running at a much lower priority as normally it would preempt the other (lower priority) tasks. If this is an issue a mutex should be used instead of a semaphore.\n\n\nSemaphores can also be used for task synchronization. A simple example of this would be the following. A task creates a semaphore and initializes it with no tokens. The task then waits on the semaphore, and since there are no tokens, the task is put to sleep. When other tasks want to wake up the sleeping task they simply add a token by calling \nos_sem_release\n. This will cause the sleeping task to wake up (instantly if no other higher priority tasks want to run).\n\n\nThe other common use of a counting semaphore is in what is commonly called a \"producer/consumer\" relationship. The producer adds tokens (by calling \nos_sem_release\n) and the consumer consumes them by calling \nos_sem_pend\n. In this relationship, the producer has work for the consumer to do. Each token added to the semaphore will cause the consumer to do whatever work is required. A simple example could be the following: every time a button is pressed there is some work to do (ring a bell). Each button press causes the producer to add a token. Each token consumed rings the bell. There will exactly the same number of bell rings as there are button presses. In other words, each call to \nos_sem_pend\n subtracts exactly one token and each call to \nos_sem_release\n adds exactly one token.\n\n\nData structures\n\n\nstruct\n \nos_sem\n\n{\n    \nSLIST_HEAD\n(, \nos_task\n) \nsem_head\n;     \n/* chain of waiting tasks */\n\n    \nuint16_t\n    \n_pad\n;\n    \nuint16_t\n    \nsem_tokens\n;             \n/* # of tokens */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsem_head\n\n\nQueue head for list of tasks waiting on semaphore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_pad\n\n\nPadding for alignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsem_tokens\n\n\nCurrent number of tokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Functions\n\n\nThe functions available in semaphore are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_sem_init\n\n\nInitialize a semaphore with a given number of tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_sem_pend\n\n\nWait for a semaphore for a given amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_sem_release\n\n\nRelease a semaphore that you are holding.

A mutex provides \npriority inheritance\n in order to prevent \npriority inversion\n. Priority inversion occurs when a higher priority task is waiting on a resource owned by a lower priority task. Using a mutex, the lower priority task will inherit the highest priority of any task waiting on the mutex. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe first order of business when using a mutex is to declare the mutex globally. The mutex needs to be initialized before it is used (see the examples). It is generally a good idea to initialize the mutex before tasks start running in order to avoid a task possibly using the mutex before it is initialized.\n\n\nWhen a task wants exclusive access to a shared resource it needs to obtain the mutex by calling \nos_mutex_pend\n. If the mutex is currently owned by a different task (a lower priority task), the requesting task will be put to sleep and the owners priority will be elevated to the priority of the requesting task. Note that multiple tasks can request ownership and the current owner is elevated to the highest priority of any task waitin on the mutex. When the task is done using the shared resource, it needs to release the mutex by called \nos_mutex_release\n. There needs to be one release per call to pend. Note that nested calls to \nos_mutex_pend\n are allowed but there needs to be one release per pend.\n\n\nThe following example will illustrate how priority inheritance works. In this example, the task number is the same as its priority. Remember that the lower the number, the higher the priority (i.e. priority 0 is higher priority than priority 1). Suppose that task 5 gets ownership of a mutex but is preempted by task 4. Task 4 attempts to gain ownership of the mutex but cannot as it is owned by task 5. Task 4 is put to sleep and task 5 is temporarily raised to priority 4. Before task 5 can release the mutex, task 3 runs and attempts to acquire the mutex. At this point, both task 3 and task 4 are waiting on the mutex (sleeping). Task 5 now runs at priority 3 (the highest priority of all the tasks waiting on the mutex). When task 5 finally releases the mutex it will be preempted as two higher priority tasks are waiting for it. \n\n\nNote that when multiple tasks are waiting on a mutex owned by another task, once the mutex is released the highest priority task waiting on the mutex is run. \n\n\nData structures\n\n\nstruct\n \nos_mutex\n\n{\n    \nSLIST_HEAD\n(, \nos_task\n) \nmu_head\n;\n    \nuint8_t\n     \n_pad\n;\n    \nuint8_t\n     \nmu_prio\n;\n    \nuint16_t\n    \nmu_level\n;\n    \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \n*mu_owner\n;\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmu_head\n\n\nQueue head for list of tasks waiting on mutex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_pad\n\n\nPadding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmu_prio\n\n\nDefault priority of owner of mutex.

Generally, memory pools are used when the developer wants to allocate a certain amount of memory to a given feature. Unlike the heap, where a code module is at the mercy of other code modules to insure there is sufficient memory, memory pools can insure sufficient memory allocation.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nIn order to create a memory pool the developer needs to do a few things. The first task is to define the memory pool itself. This is a data structure which contains information about the pool itself (i.e. number of blocks, size of the blocks, etc).\n\n\nstruct\n \nos_mempool\n \nmy_pool\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next order of business is to allocate the memory used by the memory pool. This memory can either be statically allocated (i.e. a global variable) or dynamically allocated (i.e. from the heap). When determining the amount of memory required for the memory pool, simply multiplying the number of blocks by the size of each block is not sufficient as the OS may have alignment requirements. The alignment size definition is named \nOS_ALIGNMENT\n and can be found in os_arch.h as it is architecture specific. The memory block alignment is usually for efficiency but may be due to other reasons. Generally, blocks are aligned on 32-bit boundaries. Note that memory blocks must also be of sufficient size to hold a list pointer as this is needed to chain memory blocks on the free list.\n\n\nIn order to simplify this for the user two macros have been provided: \nOS_MEMPOOL_BYTES(n, blksize)\n and \nOS_MEMPOOL_SIZE(n, blksize)\n. The first macro returns the number of bytes needed for the memory pool while the second returns the number of \nos_membuf_t\n elements required by the memory pool. The \nos_membuf_t\n type is used to guarantee that the memory buffer used by the memory pool is aligned on the correct boundary. \n\n\nHere are some examples.

            "text": "Mbufs\n\n\nThe mbuf (short for memory buffer) is a common concept in networking stacks. The mbuf is used to hold packet data as it traverses the stack. The mbuf also generally stores header information or other networking stack information that is carried around with the packet. The mbuf and its associated library of functions were developed to make common networking stack operations (like stripping and adding protocol headers) efficient and as copy-free as possible.\n\n\nIn its simplest form, an mbuf is a memory block with some space reserved for internal information and a pointer which is used to \"chain\" memory blocks together in order to create a \"packet\". This is a very important aspect of the mbuf: the ability to chain mbufs together to create larger \"packets\" (chains of mbufs).\n\n\nWhy use mbufs?\n\n\nThe main reason is to conserve memory. Consider a networking protocol that generally sends small packets but occasionally sends large ones. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is one such example. A flat buffer would need to be sized so that the maximum packet size could be contained by the buffer. With the mbuf, a number of mbufs can be chained together so that the occasional large packet can be handled while leaving more packet buffers available to the networking stack for smaller packets.\n\n\nPacket Header mbuf\n\n\nNot all mbufs are created equal. The first mbuf in a chain of mbufs is a special mbuf called a \"packet header mbuf\". The reason that this mbuf is special is that it contains the length of all the data contained by the chain of mbufs (the packet length, in other words). The packet header mbuf may also contain a user defined structure (called a \"user header\") so that networking protocol specific information can be conveyed to various layers of the networking stack. Any mbufs that are part of the packet (i.e. in the mbuf chain but not the first one) are \"normal\" (i.e. non-packet header) mbufs. A normal mbuf does not have any packet header or user packet header structures in them; they only contain the basic mbuf header (\nstruct os_mbuf\n). Figure 1 illustrates these two types of mbufs. Note that the numbers/text in parentheses denote the size of the structures/elements (in bytes) and that MBLEN is the memory block length of the memory pool used by the mbuf pool.\n\n\n\n\nNormal mbuf\n\n\nNow let's take a deeper dive into the mbuf structure. Figure 2 illustrates a normal mbuf and breaks out the various fields in the \nos_mbuf\n structure. \n\n\n\n\nThe \nom_data\n field is a pointer to where the data starts inside the data buffer. Typically, mbufs that are allocated from the mbuf pool (discussed later) have their om_data pointer set to the start of the data buffer but there are cases where this may not be desirable (added a protocol header to a packet, for example). \n\n\nThe \nom_flags\n field is a set of flags used internally by the mbuf library. Currently, no flags have been defined. \n\n\nThe \nom_pkthdr_len\n field is the total length of all packet headers in the mbuf. For normal mbufs this is set to 0 as there is no packet or user packet headers. For packet header mbufs, this would be set to the length of the packet header structure (16) plus the size of the user packet header (if any). Note that it is this field which differentiates packet header mbufs from normal mbufs (i.e. if \nom_pkthdr_len\n is zero, this is a normal mbuf; otherwise it is a packet header mbuf). \n\n\nThe \nom_len\n field contains the amount of user data in the data buffer. When initially allocated, this field is 0 as there is no user data in the mbuf. \n\n\nThe \nomp_pool\n field is a pointer to the pool from which this mbuf has been allocated. This is used internally by the mbuf library. \n\n\nThe \nomp_next\n field is a linked list element which is used to chain mbufs.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 also shows a normal mbuf with actual values in the \nos_mbuf\n structure. This mbuf starts at address 0x1000 and is 256 bytes in total length. In this example, the user has copied 33 bytes into the data buffer starting at address 0x1010 (this is where om_data points). Note that the packet header length in this mbuf is 0 as it is not a packet header mbuf.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the packet header mbuf along with some chained mbufs (i.e a \"packet\"). In this example, the user header structure is defined to be 8 bytes. Note that in figure 3 we show a number of different mbufs with varying \nom_data\n pointers and lengths since we want to show various examples of valid mbufs. For all the mbufs (both packet header and normal ones) the total length of the memory block is 128 bytes.\n\n\n\n\nMbuf pools\n\n\nMbufs are collected into \"mbuf pools\" much like memory blocks. The mbuf pool itself contains a pointer to a memory pool. The memory blocks in this memory pool are the actual mbufs; both normal and packet header mbufs. Thus, the memory block (and corresponding memory pool) must be sized correctly. In other words, the memory blocks which make up the memory pool used by the mbuf pool must be at least: sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_defined_header) + desired minimum data buffer length. For example, if the developer wants mbufs to contain at least 64 bytes of user data and they have a user header of 12 bytes, the size of the memory block would be (at least): 64 + 12 + 16 + 8, or 100 bytes. Yes, this is a fair amount of overhead. However, the flexibility provided by the mbuf library usually outweighs overhead concerns.\n\n\nCreate mbuf pool\n\n\nCreating an mbuf pool is fairly simple: create a memory pool and then create the mbuf pool using that memory pool. Once the developer has determined the size of the user data needed per mbuf (this is based on the application/networking stack and is outside the scope of this discussion) and the size of the user header (if any), the memory blocks can be sized. In the example shown below, the application requires 64 bytes of user data per mbuf and also allocates a user header (called struct user_hdr). Note that we do not show the user header data structure as there really is no need; all we need to do is to account for it when creating the memory pool. In the example, we use the macro \nMBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD\n to denote the amount of packet header overhead per mbuf and \nMBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD\n to denote the total amount of overhead required per memory block. The macro \nMBUF_BUF_SIZE\n is used to denote the amount of payload that the application requires (aligned on a 32-bit boundary in this case). All this leads to the total memory block size required, denoted by the macro \nMBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD\n.\n\n\n#define MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD    sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_hdr)\n\n\n#define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD  sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD\n\n\n\n#define MBUF_NUM_MBUFS      (32)\n\n\n#define MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE   (64)\n\n\n#define MBUF_BUF_SIZE       OS_ALIGN(MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE, 4)\n\n\n#define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE  (MBUF_BUF_SIZE + MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD)\n\n\n#define MBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE   OS_MEMPOOL_SIZE(MBUF_NUM_MBUFS, MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE)\n\n\n\nstruct\n \nos_mbuf_pool\n \ng_mbuf_pool\n; \n\nstruct\n \nos_mempool\n \ng_mbuf_mempool\n;\n\nos_membuf_t\n \ng_mbuf_buffer\n[\nMBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE\n];\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ncreate_mbuf_pool\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \nint\n \nrc\n;\n\n    \nrc\n \n=\n \nos_mempool_init\n(\n&g_mbuf_mempool\n, \nMBUF_NUM_MBUFS\n, \n                          \nMBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE\n, \n&g_mbuf_buffer\n[\n0\n], \n\"mbuf_pool\"\n);\n    \nassert\n(\nrc\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n\n    \nrc\n \n=\n \nos_mbuf_pool_init\n(\n&g_mbuf_pool\n, \n&g_mbuf_mempool\n, \nMBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE\n, \n                           \nMBUF_NUM_MBUFS\n);\n    \nassert\n(\nrc\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing mbufs\n\n\nThe following examples illustrate typical mbuf usage. There are two basic mbuf allocation API: \nos_mbuf_get()\n and \nos_mbuf_get_pkthdr()\n. The first API obtains a normal mbuf whereas the latter obtains a packet header mbuf. Typically, application developers use \nos_mbuf_get_pkthdr()\n and rarely, if ever, need to call \nos_mbuf_get()\n as the rest of the mbuf API (e.g. \nos_mbuf_append()\n, \nos_mbuf_copyinto()\n, etc.) typically deal with allocating and chaining mbufs. It is recommended to use the provided API to copy data into/out of mbuf chains and/or manipulate mbufs.\n\n\nIn \nexample1\n, the developer creates a packet and then sends the packet to a networking interface. The code sample also provides an example of copying data out of an mbuf as well as use of the \"pullup\" api (another very common mbuf api).\n\n\nvoid\n\n\nmbuf_usage_example1\n(\nuint8_t\n \n*mydata\n, \nint\n \nmydata_length\n)\n{\n    \nint\n \nrc\n;\n    \nstruct\n \nos_mbuf\n \n*om\n;\n\n    \n/* get a packet header mbuf */\n\n    \nom\n \n=\n \nos_mbuf_get_pkthdr\n(\n&g_mbuf_pool\n, \nsizeof\n(\nstruct\n \nuser_hdr\n));\n    \nif\n (\nom\n) {\n        \n/* \n\n\n         * Copy user data into mbuf.

The first pitfall is one of alignment/padding. Depending on the processor and/or compiler, the sizeof() a structure may vary. Thus, the size of \nmy_protocol_header\n may be different inside the packet data of the mbuf than the size of the structure on the stack or as a global variable, for instance. While some networking protcols may align protocol information on convenient processor boundaries many others try to conserve bytes \"on the air\" (i.e inside the packet data). Typical methods used to deal with this are \"packing\" the structure (i.e. force compiler to not pad) or creating protocol headers that do not require padding. \nexample2\n assumes that one of these methods was used when defining the \nmy_protocol_header\n structure.\n\n\nAnother common pitfall occurs around endianness. A network protocol may be little endian or big endian; it all depends on the protocol specification. Processors also have an endianness; this means that the developer has to be careful that the processor endianness and the protocol endianness are handled correctly. In \nexample2\n, some common networking functions are used: \nntohs()\n and \nntohl()\n. These are shorthand for \"network order to host order, short\" and \"network order to host order, long\". Basically, these functions convert data of a certain size (i.e. 16 bits, 32 bits, etc) to the endianness of the host. Network byte order is big-endian (most significant byte first), so these functions convert big-endian byte order to host order (thus, the implementation of these functions is host dependent). Note that the BLE networking stack \"on the air\" format is least signigicant byte first (i.e. little endian), so a \"bletoh\" function would have to take little endian format and convert to host format.\n\n\nA long story short: the developer must take care when copying structure data to/from mbufs and flat buffers!\n\n\nA final note: these examples assume the same mbuf struture and definitions used in the first example. \n\n\nvoid\n\n\nmbuf_usage_example2\n(\nstruct\n \nmbuf\n \n*rxpkt\n)\n{\n    \nint\n \nrc\n;\n    \nuint8_t\n \npacket_data\n[\n16\n];\n    \nstruct\n \nmbuf\n \n*om\n;\n    \nstruct\n \nmy_protocol_header\n \n*phdr\n;\n\n    \n/* Make sure that \"my_protocol_header\" bytes are contiguous in mbuf */\n\n    \nom\n \n=\n \nos_mbuf_pullup\n(\n&g_mbuf_pool\n, \nsizeof\n(\nstruct\n \nmy_protocol_header\n));\n    \nif\n (\n!om\n) {\n        \n/* Not able to pull up data into contiguous area */\n\n        \nreturn\n \n-\n1\n;\n    }\n\n    \n/* \n\n\n     * Get the protocol information from the packet.

The packet header mbuf may also contain a user defined structure (called a \"user header\") so that networking protocol specific information can be conveyed to various layers of the networking stack. Any mbufs that are part of the packet (i.e. in the mbuf chain but not the first one) are \"normal\" (i.e. non-packet header) mbufs.

The  om_data  field is a pointer to where the data starts inside the data buffer. Typically, mbufs that are allocated from the mbuf pool (discussed later) have their om_data pointer set to the start of the data buffer but there are cases where this may not be desirable (added a protocol header to a packet, for example).   The  om_flags  field is a set of flags used internally by the mbuf library. Currently, no flags have been defined.   The  om_pkthdr_len  field is the total length of all packet headers in the mbuf. For normal mbufs this is set to 0 as there is no packet or user packet headers. For packet header mbufs, this would be set to the length of the packet header structure (16) plus the size of the user packet header (if any). Note that it is this field which differentiates packet header mbufs from normal mbufs (i.e. if  om_pkthdr_len  is zero, this is a normal mbuf; otherwise it is a packet header mbuf).   The  om_len  field contains the amount of user data in the data buffer. When initially allocated, this field is 0 as there is no user data in the mbuf.   The  omp_pool  field is a pointer to the pool from which this mbuf has been allocated. This is used internally by the mbuf library.   The  omp_next  field is a linked list element which is used to chain mbufs.   Figure 2 also shows a normal mbuf with actual values in the  os_mbuf  structure. This mbuf starts at address 0x1000 and is 256 bytes in total length. In this example, the user has copied 33 bytes into the data buffer starting at address 0x1010 (this is where om_data points). Note that the packet header length in this mbuf is 0 as it is not a packet header mbuf.   Figure 3 illustrates the packet header mbuf along with some chained mbufs (i.e a \"packet\"). In this example, the user header structure is defined to be 8 bytes. Note that in figure 3 we show a number of different mbufs with varying  om_data  pointers and lengths since we want to show various examples of valid mbufs.

All this leads to the total memory block size required, denoted by the macro  MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD .  #define MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD    sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_hdr)  #define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD  sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD  #define MBUF_NUM_MBUFS      (32)  #define MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE   (64)  #define MBUF_BUF_SIZE       OS_ALIGN(MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE, 4)  #define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE  (MBUF_BUF_SIZE + MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD)  #define MBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE   OS_MEMPOOL_SIZE(MBUF_NUM_MBUFS, MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE)  struct   os_mbuf_pool   g_mbuf_pool ;  struct   os_mempool   g_mbuf_mempool ; os_membuf_t   g_mbuf_buffer [ MBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE ]; void  create_mbuf_pool ( void )\n{\n     int   rc ;\n\n     rc   =   os_mempool_init ( &g_mbuf_mempool ,  MBUF_NUM_MBUFS , \n                           MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE ,  &g_mbuf_buffer [ 0 ],  \"mbuf_pool\" );\n     assert ( rc   ==   0 );\n\n     rc   =   os_mbuf_pool_init ( &g_mbuf_pool ,  &g_mbuf_mempool ,  MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE , \n                            MBUF_NUM_MBUFS );\n     assert ( rc   ==   0 );\n}",

            "text": "The following examples illustrate typical mbuf usage. There are two basic mbuf allocation API:  os_mbuf_get()  and  os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() . The first API obtains a normal mbuf whereas the latter obtains a packet header mbuf. Typically, application developers use  os_mbuf_get_pkthdr()  and rarely, if ever, need to call  os_mbuf_get()  as the rest of the mbuf API (e.g.  os_mbuf_append() ,  os_mbuf_copyinto() , etc.) typically deal with allocating and chaining mbufs. It is recommended to use the provided API to copy data into/out of mbuf chains and/or manipulate mbufs.  In  example1 , the developer creates a packet and then sends the packet to a networking interface. The code sample also provides an example of copying data out of an mbuf as well as use of the \"pullup\" api (another very common mbuf api).  void  mbuf_usage_example1 ( uint8_t   *mydata ,  int   mydata_length )\n{\n     int   rc ;\n     struct   os_mbuf   *om ;\n\n     /* get a packet header mbuf */ \n     om   =   os_mbuf_get_pkthdr ( &g_mbuf_pool ,  sizeof ( struct   user_hdr ));\n     if  ( om ) {\n         /*            * Copy user data into mbuf. NOTE: if mydata_length is greater than the           * mbuf payload size (64 bytes using above example), mbufs are allocated           * and chained together to accommodate the total packet length.           */ \n         rc   =   os_mbuf_copyinto ( om ,  0 ,  mydata ,  len );\n         if  ( rc ) {\n             /* Error! Could not allocate enough mbufs for total packet length */ \n             return   - 1 ;\n        }\n\n         /* Send packet to networking interface */ \n         send_pkt ( om );\n    }\n}  In  example2  we show use of the pullup api as this illustrates some of the typical pitfalls developers encounter when using mbufs. The first pitfall is one of alignment/padding. Depending on the processor and/or compiler, the sizeof() a structure may vary. Thus, the size of  my_protocol_header  may be different inside the packet data of the mbuf than the size of the structure on the stack or as a global variable, for instance. While some networking protcols may align protocol information on convenient processor boundaries many others try to conserve bytes \"on the air\" (i.e inside the packet data). Typical methods used to deal with this are \"packing\" the structure (i.e. force compiler to not pad) or creating protocol headers that do not require padding.  example2  assumes that one of these methods was used when defining the  my_protocol_header  structure.  Another common pitfall occurs around endianness. A network protocol may be little endian or big endian; it all depends on the protocol specification. Processors also have an endianness; this means that the developer has to be careful that the processor endianness and the protocol endianness are handled correctly. In  example2 , some common networking functions are used:  ntohs()  and  ntohl() . These are shorthand for \"network order to host order, short\" and \"network order to host order, long\". Basically, these functions convert data of a certain size (i.e. 16 bits, 32 bits, etc) to the endianness of the host. Network byte order is big-endian (most significant byte first), so these functions convert big-endian byte order to host order (thus, the implementation of these functions is host dependent). Note that the BLE networking stack \"on the air\" format is least signigicant byte first (i.e. little endian), so a \"bletoh\" function would have to take little endian format and convert to host format.  A long story short: the developer must take care when copying structure data to/from mbufs and flat buffers!  A final note: these examples assume the same mbuf struture and definitions used in the first example.   void  mbuf_usage_example2 ( struct   mbuf   *rxpkt )\n{\n     int   rc ;\n     uint8_t   packet_data [ 16 ];\n     struct   mbuf   *om ;\n     struct   my_protocol_header   *phdr ;\n\n     /* Make sure that \"my_protocol_header\" bytes are contiguous in mbuf */ \n     om   =   os_mbuf_pullup ( &g_mbuf_pool ,  sizeof ( struct   my_protocol_header ));\n     if  ( !om ) {\n         /* Not able to pull up data into contiguous area */ \n         return   - 1 ;\n    }\n\n     /*        * Get the protocol information from the packet.

The msys code will choose the mbuf pool with the smallest mbufs that can accommodate the requested size. \n\n\nLet us walk through an example where the user registers three mbuf pools with msys: one with 32 byte mbufs, one with 256 and one with 2048. If the user requests an mbuf with 10 bytes, the 32-byte mbuf pool is used. If the request is for 33 bytes the 256 byte mbuf pool is used. If an mbuf data size is requested that is larger than any of the pools (say, 4000 bytes) the largest pool is used. While this behaviour may not be optimal in all cases that is the currently implemented behaviour. All this means is that the user is not guaranteed that a single mbuf can hold the requested data.\n\n\nThe msys code will not allocate an mbuf from a larger pool if the chosen mbuf pool is empty. Similarly, the msys code will not chain together a number of smaller mbufs to accommodate the requested size. While this behaviour may change in future implementations the current code will simply return NULL. Using the above example, say the user requests 250 bytes. The msys code chooses the appropriate pool (i.e. the 256 byte mbuf pool) and attempts to allocate an mbuf from that pool. If that pool is empty, NULL is returned even though the 32 and 2048 byte pools are not empty.\n\n\nNote that no added descriptions on how to use the msys API are presented here (other than in the API descriptions themselves) as the msys API is used in exactly the same manner as the mbuf API.

If your MCU is not supported by Mynewt, see \nMCU Porting\n for details on how to create an MCU in Mynewt.\n\n\nThe package file may also contain:\n\n\n    \npkg\n.\ncflags\n: \n-D__MY_SPECIAL_BSP_OPTIONS_\n\n    \npkg\n.\ndeps\n:\n    \n-\n \nlibs/cmsis-core\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg.cflags\n\n\nAny specific compiler flags for your bsp\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg.deps\n\n\nAny other libraries that may be required.  Some architectures (like ARM) have special libraries to make BSP creation easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate or Copy Linker Script\n\n\nIt's probably best to start with a linker script from another BSP using the same MCU.  If this is not available, consult your MCU documentation and library samples to find a linker script to start with.\n\n\nTypically, a linker script has to specify the following sections for code:\n\n\n\n\n.text -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store your code\n\n\n.data -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store initialized data\n\n\n.bss -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store uninitialized data\n\n\n.heap -- the location and alignment of the memory section to provide system memory\n\n\n\n\nThe linker script should specify the location and size of the different memory regions in your BSP and map the code sections described above into these regions.  \n\n\nThe linker script should also include an ENTRY point. This is used by the debugger to know where to start the program counter when the target is debugged.\n\n\nThere may be additional requirements from the MCU or OS that you may find easiest to place in the linker script. Some specific variables that the OS and MCU depends on are :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__bss_start__\n\n\na variable located at the start of the BSS section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__bss_end__\n\n\na variable located at the end of the BSS section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__isr_vector\n\n\nSome CPUs map their interrupt vectors. They may need to be specified in the linker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_user_heap_start\n\n\nthe start of the heap for unallocated memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_user_heap_end\n\n\nthe end of the heap for unallocated memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an alternate linker script for the bootloader since it is typically linked to use different addresses to boot the main image.  \n\n\nAdd Functions and Defines\n\n\nAt this point, it will be possible to run the \nnewt\n tool to build your target. \n\n\nYou may run into complaints from the linker script that a few Mynewt specific functions are missing.  We will describe these below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_bsp_init()\n\n\ncode to initialize the bsp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_bsp_systick_init()\n\n\ncode to setup the system tick for the OS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also several libc definitions that can be stubbed in your first BSP. Examples are \n_write\n, \n_read\n, etc. that can be found in \nlibc_stubs.c\n. But you \nmust\n implement the following function to provide memory to the OS and system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_sbrk\n\n\nReturns memory from heap (used by malloc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement \n_sbrk()\n\n\n\n\nsbrk()\n is required by libc to get memory from the heap for things like malloc. Although not strongly BSP dependent, this is currently in the BSP to allow  flexibility in providing system memory.  See other BSPs for providing \nsbrk\n functionality.\n\n\n\n\nImplement \nos_bsp_init()\n\n\n\n\nos_bsp_init\n should initialize anything required by the OS by the BSP. Typically this is a very small set.  \n\n\nNOTE: Currently we are making calls to \n_sbrk()\n and \nclose(0)\n from \nos_bsp_init\n to get around a linker issue where some of libc is not getting included.  Please include this in your \nos_bsp_init\n.\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n     * XXX these references are here to keep the functions in for libc to find.\n\n\n     */\n\n    \n_sbrk\n(\n0\n);\n    \n_close\n(\n0\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Unresolved Defines or Functions\n\n\n\n\nThere may be other unresolved defines or functions that are required by the specific MCU within your BSP. Below lists some sample defines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndefined Variable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONSOLE_UART_PORT\n\n\nWhich communications port on your target runs the console\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED_BLINK_PIN\n\n\nwhich pin on your target runs the blinky LED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set of missing functionality depends upon the libraries and dependencies you have included in the project.  That's why its best to keep your first project pretty simple then add incrementally.  For example, if you include Newtron file system, you will need to define a file system map for your BSP.\n\n\nMissing functionality may take the form of \n#define\n items required to compile, or they may take the form of missing functions.  \n\n\n\n\ncmsis_nvic.h\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using an ARM cortex architecture, you need to define the number of interrupts supported by your system.  If you are not using ARM Cortex architecture this may not be required (but something else might be).\n\n\nAdd Debug Script\n\n\nThe debug script in the bsp directory allows the newt tool to automatically connect to the debugger, and create a debug session with the target.  This requires knowledge of your target debug interface. Most of the Mynewt BSP targets use \nopenocd\n to perform debugging.  This script typically creates an openocd connection to the target and then connects a gdb instance to this openocd connection.  There are several examples in existing BSPs to follow.\n\n\nThe script must take a single argument which is the name of the image file minus the '.elf' suffix.\n\n\nThe BSP is complete without this file, but newt will be unable to establish a debug session without it.\n\n\nAdd Download Script\n\n\nSimilar to the debug script, the download script is a hook for newt to download the image to the target system.  The download script also typically uses openocd interface to erase flash, and progam the code into the device.\n\n\nNOTE: The download script needs to command openocd to program the image into the appropriate location, which is typically called \nFLASH_OFFSET\n in  these scripts. This location has to match the linker script location of the image link address.  For example, if your linker links the code to be run at \n0xC000\n your download script should download the image to the same\naddress in the correct flash.  \n\n\nAdd License and Documentation\n\n\nThe \nLICENSE\n file is an ASCII text file that describes the source license for this\npackage.\n\n\nThe \nREADME.md\n is a \nmarkdown\n\n file that contains any documentation you \nwant to provide for the BSP.",

The text written on the console brings some information and is a sequence of characters sent by the OS or programs running on the OS. \n\n\nSupport is currently available for console access via the serial port on the hardware board.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nIn the Mynewt OS, the console library comes in two versions:\n\n\n\n\nfull - containing the full implementation\n\n\nstub - containing stubs for the API\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these have \npkg.yml\n file which states that they provide the \nconsole\n API. If a pkg uses this API, it should list \nconsole\n as a requirement.\nFor example, the shell pkg is defined by the following pkg.yml file:\n\n\n    pkg.name: libs/shell \n    pkg.vers: 0.1\n    pkg.deps:\n        - libs/os\n        - libs/util\n    pkg.reqs:\n        - console\n    pkg.identities:\n        - SHELL \n\n\n\n\n\nThe project .yml file decides which version of the console pkg should be included. \nIf project requires the full console capability it lists dependency \nlibs/console/full\n in its pkg.yml file. On the other hand, a project may not have a physical console (e.g. a UART port to connect a terminal to) but may have a dependency on a pkg that has console capability. In that case you would use a console stub. \n\n\nAnother example would be the bootloader project where we want to keep the size of the image small. It includes the \nlibs/os\n pkg that can print out messages on a console (e.g. if there is a hard fault) and the \nlibs/util\n pkg that uses full console (but only if SHELL is present to provide a CLI).

If a pkg uses this API, it should list  console  as a requirement.\nFor example, the shell pkg is defined by the following pkg.yml file:      pkg.name: libs/shell \n    pkg.vers: 0.1\n    pkg.deps:\n        - libs/os\n        - libs/util\n    pkg.reqs:\n        - console\n    pkg.identities:\n        - SHELL   The project .yml file decides which version of the console pkg should be included. \nIf project requires the full console capability it lists dependency  libs/console/full  in its pkg.yml file. On the other hand, a project may not have a physical console (e.g. a UART port to connect a terminal to) but may have a dependency on a pkg that has console capability. In that case you would use a console stub.   Another example would be the bootloader project where we want to keep the size of the image small. It includes the  libs/os  pkg that can print out messages on a console (e.g. if there is a hard fault) and the  libs/util  pkg that uses full console (but only if SHELL is present to provide a CLI).

By accessing the file system via the \nfs/fs\n API, client code can perform file system operations without being tied to a particular implementation.  When possible, library code should use the \nfs/fs\n API rather than accessing the underlying file system directly.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nApplications should aim to minimize the amount of code which depends on a particular file system implementation.  When possible, only depend on the \nfs/fs\n package.  In the simplest case, the only code which needs to know which file system is in use is the code which initializes the file system.  In terms of the Mynewt hierarchy, the \napp\n package must depend on a specific file system package, while \nlibrary\n packages should only depend on \nfs/fs\n.\n\n\nThe following example illustrates how file system dependencies should be managed.  In the slinky application, the app is responsible for initializing the file system, so it depends on a concrete file system package called \nfs/nffs\n (Newtron Flash File System). The app explicitly initializes nffs via calls to \nnffs_init()\n, \nnffs_detect()\n and \nnffs_format()\n.\n\n\n# repos/apache-mynewt-core/apps/slinky/pkg.yml\n\npkg.name: repos/apache-mynewt-core/apps/slinky\npkg.deps:\n    - fs/nffs\n\n# [...]\n\n\n\n\n\n/* repos/apache-mynewt-core/apps/slinky/src/main.c */\n\n\n\n#include\n \n\"nffs/nffs.h\"\n\n\n\nint\n\n\nmain\n(\nint\n \nargc\n, \nchar\n \n**argv\n)\n{\n    \nint\n \nrc\n;\n    \nint\n \ncnt\n;\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_area_desc\n \ndescs\n[\nNFFS_AREA_MAX\n];\n\n    \nrc\n \n=\n \nnffs_init\n();\n    \nassert\n(\nrc\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n\n    \ncnt\n \n=\n \nNFFS_AREA_MAX\n;\n    \nrc\n \n=\n \nflash_area_to_nffs_desc\n(\nFLASH_AREA_NFFS\n, \n&cnt\n, \ndescs\n);\n    \nassert\n(\nrc\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n    \nif\n (\nnffs_detect\n(\ndescs\n) \n==\n \nFS_ECORRUPT\n) {\n        \nrc\n \n=\n \nnffs_format\n(\ndescs\n);\n        \nassert\n(\nrc\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n    }\n    \n// [...]\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, code which uses the file system after it has been initialized need only depend on \nfs/fs\n.  For example, the \nlibs/imgmgr\n package is a library which provides firmware upload and download functionality via the use of a file system.  This library is only used after the main app has initialized the file system, and therefore only depends on the \nfs/fs\n package.\n\n\n# repos/apache-mynewt-core/libs/imgmgr/pkg.yml\npkg.name: libs/imgmgr\npkg.deps:\n    - fs/fs\n\n# [...]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nlibs/imgmgr\n package uses the \nfs/fs\n API for all file system operations.\n\n\nThread Safety\n\n\nAll \nfs/fs\n functions are thread safe.\n\n\nHeader Files\n\n\nAll code which uses the \nfs/fs\n package needs to include the following header:\n\n\n#include\n \n\"fs/fs.h\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Structures\n\n\nAll \nfs/fs\n data structures are opaque to client code.\n\n\nstruct\n \nfs_file\n;\n\nstruct\n \nfs_dir\n;\n\nstruct\n \nfs_dirent\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI\n\n\nFunctions in \nfs/fs\n that indicate success or failure do so with the following set of return codes:\n\n\n\n\nReturn Codes\n\n\n\n\nThe functions available in this OS feature are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_close\n\n\nCloses the specified file and invalidates the file handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_closedir\n\n\nCloses the specified directory handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_dirent_is_dir\n\n\nTells you whether the specified directory entry is a sub-directory or a regular file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_dirent_name\n\n\nRetrieves the filename of the specified directory entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_filelen\n\n\nRetrieves the current length of the specified open file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_getpos\n\n\nRetrieves the current read and write position of the specified open file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_mkdir\n\n\nCreates the directory represented by the specified path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_open\n\n\nOpens a file at the specified path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_opendir\n\n\nOpens the directory at the specified path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_read\n\n\nReads data from the specified file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_readdir\n\n\nReads the next entry in an open directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_register\n\n\nRegisters a file system with the abstraction layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_rename\n\n\nPerforms a rename and/or move of the specified source path to the specified destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_seek\n\n\nPositions a file's read and write pointer at the specified offset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_unlink\n\n\nUnlinks the file or directory at the specified path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfs_write\n\n\nWrites the supplied data to the current offset of the specified file handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional file system utilities that bundle some of the basic functions above are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfsutil_read_file\n\n\nOpens a file at the specified path, retrieve data from the file starting from the specified offset, and close the file and invalidate the file handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfsutil_write_file\n\n\nOpen a file at the specified path, write the supplied data to the current offset of the specified file handle, and close the file and invalidate the file handle.",

            "text": "Applications should aim to minimize the amount of code which depends on a particular file system implementation.  When possible, only depend on the  fs/fs  package.  In the simplest case, the only code which needs to know which file system is in use is the code which initializes the file system.  In terms of the Mynewt hierarchy, the  app  package must depend on a specific file system package, while  library  packages should only depend on  fs/fs .  The following example illustrates how file system dependencies should be managed.  In the slinky application, the app is responsible for initializing the file system, so it depends on a concrete file system package called  fs/nffs  (Newtron Flash File System). The app explicitly initializes nffs via calls to  nffs_init() ,  nffs_detect()  and  nffs_format() .  # repos/apache-mynewt-core/apps/slinky/pkg.yml\n\npkg.name: repos/apache-mynewt-core/apps/slinky\npkg.deps:\n    - fs/nffs\n\n# [...]  /* repos/apache-mynewt-core/apps/slinky/src/main.c */  #include   \"nffs/nffs.h\"  int  main ( int   argc ,  char   **argv )\n{\n     int   rc ;\n     int   cnt ;\n     struct   nffs_area_desc   descs [ NFFS_AREA_MAX ];\n\n     rc   =   nffs_init ();\n     assert ( rc   ==   0 );\n\n     cnt   =   NFFS_AREA_MAX ;\n     rc   =   flash_area_to_nffs_desc ( FLASH_AREA_NFFS ,  &cnt ,  descs );\n     assert ( rc   ==   0 );\n     if  ( nffs_detect ( descs )  ==   FS_ECORRUPT ) {\n         rc   =   nffs_format ( descs );\n         assert ( rc   ==   0 );\n    }\n     // [...] \n}  On the other hand, code which uses the file system after it has been initialized need only depend on  fs/fs .  For example, the  libs/imgmgr  package is a library which provides firmware upload and download functionality via the use of a file system.  This library is only used after the main app has initialized the file system, and therefore only depends on the  fs/fs  package.  # repos/apache-mynewt-core/libs/imgmgr/pkg.yml\npkg.name: libs/imgmgr\npkg.deps:\n    - fs/fs\n\n# [...]  The  libs/imgmgr  package uses the  fs/fs  API for all file system operations.",

The ID space is partitioned as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID range\n\n\nNode type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0x00000000 - 0x0fffffff\n\n\nDirectory inodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0x10000000 - 0x7fffffff\n\n\nFile inodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0x80000000 - 0xfffffffe\n\n\nData blocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0xffffffff\n\n\nReserved (NFFS_ID_NONE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScratch area\n\n\nA valid nffs file system must contain a single \"scratch area.\"  The scratch area does not contain any objects of its own, and is only used during garbage collection.  The scratch area must have a size greater than or equal to each of the other areas in flash.\n\n\nRAM representation\n\n\nEvery object in the file system is stored in a 256-entry hash table.  An object's hash key is derived from its 32-bit ID.  Each list in the hash table is sorted by time of use; most-recently-used is at the front of the list. All objects are represented by the following structure:\n\n\n/**\n\n\n * What gets stored in the hash table.  Each entry represents a data block or\n\n\n * an inode.\n\n\n */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n {\n    \nSLIST_ENTRY\n(\nnffs_hash_entry\n) \nnhe_next\n;\n    \nuint32_t\n \nnhe_id\n;        \n/* 0 - 0x7fffffff if inode; else if block. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nnhe_flash_loc\n; \n/* Upper-byte = area idx; rest = area offset. */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each data block, the above structure is all that is stored in RAM.  To acquire more information about a data block, the block header must be read from flash.\n\n\nInodes require a fuller RAM representation to capture the structure of the file system.  There are two types of inodes: \nfiles\n and \ndirectories\n.  Each inode hash entry is actually an instance of the following structure:\n\n\n/** Each inode hash entry is actually one of these. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_entry\n {\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n \nnie_hash_entry\n;\n    \nSLIST_ENTRY\n(\nnffs_inode_entry\n) \nnie_sibling_next\n;\n    \nunion\n {\n        \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_list\n \nnie_child_list\n;           \n/* If directory */\n\n        \nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n \n*nie_last_block_entry\n;    \n/* If file */\n\n    };\n    \nuint8_t\n \nnie_refcnt\n;\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nA directory inode contains a list of its child files and directories (\nfie_child_list\n).  These entries are sorted alphabetically using the ASCII character set.\n\n\nA file inode contains a pointer to the last data block in the file (\nnie_last_block_entry\n).  For most file operations, the reversed block list must be walked backwards.  This introduces a number of speed inefficiencies:\n\n\n\n\nAll data blocks must be read to determine the length of the file.\n\n\nData blocks often need to be processed sequentially.  The reversed nature of the block list transforms this from linear time to an O(n^2) operation.\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, obtaining information about any constituent data block requires a separate flash read.\n\n\nInode cache and Data Block cache\n\n\nThe speed issues are addressed by a pair of caches.  Cached inodes entries contain the file length and a much more convenient doubly-linked list of cached data blocks.  The benefit of using caches is that the size of the caches need not be proportional to the size of the file system.  In other words, caches can address speed efficiency concerns without negatively impacting the file system's scalability.\n\n\nnffs requires both caches during normal operation, so it is not possible to disable them.  However, the cache sizes are configurable, and both caches can be configured with a size of one if RAM usage must be minimized.\n\n\nThe following data structures are used in the inode and data block caches.\n\n\n/** Full data block representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_block\n {\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n \n*nb_hash_entry\n;   \n/* Points to real block entry. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nnb_seq\n;                         \n/* Sequence number; greater\n\n\n                                                supersedes lesser. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_entry\n \n*nb_inode_entry\n; \n/* Owning inode. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n \n*nb_prev\n;         \n/* Previous block in file. */\n\n    \nuint16_t\n \nnb_data_len\n;                    \n/* # of data bytes in block. */\n\n    \nuint16_t\n \nreserved16\n;\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n/** Represents a single cached data block. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_cache_block\n {\n    \nTAILQ_ENTRY\n(\nnffs_cache_block\n) \nncb_link\n; \n/* Next / prev cached block. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_block\n \nncb_block\n;            \n/* Full data block. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nncb_file_offset\n;               \n/* File offset of this block. */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n/** Full inode representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_inode\n {\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_entry\n \n*ni_inode_entry\n; \n/* Points to real inode entry. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nni_seq\n;                         \n/* Sequence number; greater\n\n\n                                                supersedes lesser. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_entry\n \n*ni_parent\n;      \n/* Points to parent directory. */\n\n    \nuint8_t\n \nni_filename_len\n;                 \n/* # chars in filename. */\n\n    \nuint8_t\n \nni_filename\n[\nNFFS_SHORT_FILENAME_LEN\n]; \n/* First 3 bytes. */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n/** Doubly-linked tail queue of cached blocks; contained in cached inodes. */\n\n\nTAILQ_HEAD\n(\nnffs_block_cache_list\n, \nnffs_block_cache_entry\n);\n\n\n/** Represents a single cached file inode. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_cache_inode\n {\n    \nTAILQ_ENTRY\n(\nnffs_cache_inode\n) \nnci_link\n;        \n/* Sorted; LRU at tail. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode\n \nnci_inode\n;                   \n/* Full inode. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_cache_block_list\n \nnci_block_list\n;   \n/* List of cached blocks. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nnci_file_size\n;                        \n/* Total file size. */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly file inodes are cached; directory inodes are never cached.\n\n\nWithin a cached inode, all cached data blocks are contiguous.  E.g., if the start and end of a file are cached, then the middle must also be cached.  A data block is only cached if its owning file is also cached.\n\n\nInternally, cached inodes are stored in a singly-linked list, ordered by time of use.  The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list.  If a new inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the least-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one.  The following operations cause an inode to be cached:\n\n\n\n\nQuerying a file's length.\n\n\nSeeking within a file.\n\n\nReading from a file.\n\n\nWriting to a file.\n\n\n\n\nThe following operations cause a data block to be cached:\n\n\n\n\nReading from the block.\n\n\nWriting to the block.\n\n\n\n\nIf one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently cached, nffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary block:\n\n\n\n\nIf none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a cached block entry corresponding to the requested block and insert it into the inode's list.\n\n\nElse if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and the block that now needs to be cached.  This is accomplished by caching each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block.\n\n\nElse (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache),\n\n\nIf the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the list.\n\n\nElse, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry corresponding to the requested block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during the above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache. This is accomplished as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the least-recently-used entry).  For each entry:\n\n\nIf the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next entry.\n\n\nElse, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above procedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry.  The above procedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very inode being operated on.  This is OK, as the final block to get cached is always the block being requested.\n\n\nDetection\n\n\nThe file system detection process consists of scanning a specified set of flash regions for valid nffs areas, and then populating the RAM representation of the file system with the detected objects.  Detection is initiated with the \nnffs_detect()\n function.\n\n\nNot every area descriptor passed to \nnffs_detect()\n needs to reference a valid nffs area.  Detection is successful as long as a complete file system is detected somewhere in the specified regions of flash.  If an application is unsure where a file system might be located, it can initiate detection across the entire flash region.\n\n\nA detected file system is valid if:\n\n\n\n\nAt least one non-scratch area is present.\n\n\nAt least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if there is more than one).\n\n\nThe root directory inode is present.\n\n\n\n\nDuring detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area header.  The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into the nffs RAM representation.  The following procedure is applied to each object in the area:\n\n\n\n\nVerify the object's integrity via a crc16 check.  If invalid, the object is discarded and the procedure restarts on the next object in the area.\n\n\nConvert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and insert it into the hash table.  If the object is an inode, its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by its parent directory.\n\n\nIf an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes the other.  Accept the object with the greater sequence number and discard the other.\n\n\nIf the object references a nonexistent inode (parent directory in the case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a temporary \"dummy\" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored.  Dummy inodes are identified by a reference count of 0.\n\n\nIf a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode's parent pointer is set to null to indicate that it should be removed from RAM.\n\n\n\n\nIf nffs encounters an object that cannot be identified (i.e., its magic number is not valid), it scans the remainder of the flash area for the next valid magic number.  Upon encountering a valid object, nffs resumes the procedure described above.\n\n\nAfter all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM representation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory.\n\n\nFor each directory inode:\n\n\n\n\nIf its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), migrate its children to the \n/lost+found\n directory, and delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.\n\n\nIf its parent reference is null (i.e., it was deleted), delete it and all its children from the RAM representation.\n\n\n\n\nFor each file inode:\n\n\n\n\nIf its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), delete it from the RAM representation.  This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.  (We should try to migrate the file to the lost+found directory in this case, as mentioned in the todo section).\n\n\n\n\nWhen an object is deleted during this sweep, it is only deleted from the RAM representation; nothing is written to disk.\n\n\nWhen objects are migrated to the lost+found directory, their parent inode reference is permanently updated on the disk.\n\n\nIn addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process.  The first area whose \nfda_id\n value is set to 0xff is designated as the file system scratch area.  If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be that the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress.  Such a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID.  In such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the scratch area.\n\n\nFormatting\n\n\nA new nffs file system is created via formatting.  Formatting is achieved via the \nnffs_format()\n function.\n\n\nDuring a successful format, an area header is written to each of the specified locations.  One of the areas in the set is designated as the initial scratch area.\n\n\nFlash writes\n\n\nThe nffs implementation always writes in a strictly sequential fashion within an area.  For each area, the system keeps track of the current offset.  Whenever an object gets written to an area, it gets written to that area's current offset, and the offset is increased by the object's disk size.\n\n\nWhen a write needs to be performed, the nffs implementation selects the appropriate destination area by iterating though each area until one with sufficient free space is encountered.\n\n\nThere is no write buffering.  Each call to a write function results in a write operation being sent to the flash hardware.\n\n\nNew objects\n\n\nWhenever a new object is written to disk, it is assigned the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID:\n A unique value is selected from the 32-bit ID space, as appropriate for the object's type.\n\n\nSequence number:\n 0\n\n\n\n\nWhen a new file or directory is created, a corresponding inode is written to flash.  Likewise, a new data block also results in the writing of a corresponding disk object.\n\n\nMoving/Renaming files and directories\n\n\nWhen a file or directory is moved or renamed, its corresponding inode is rewritten to flash with the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID:\n Unchanged\n\n\nSequence number:\n Previous value plus one.\n\n\nParent inode:\n As specified by the move / rename operation.\n\n\nFilename:\n As specified by the move / rename operation.\n\n\n\n\nBecause the inode's ID is unchanged, all dependent objects remain valid.\n\n\nUnlinking files and directories\n\n\nWhen a file or directory is unlinked from its parent directory, a deletion record for the unlinked inode gets written to flash.  The deletion record is an inode with the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID:\n Unchanged\n\n\nSequence number:\n Previous value plus one.\n\n\nParent inode ID:\n NFFS_ID_NONE\n\n\n\n\nWhen an inode is unlinked, no deletion records need to be written for the inode's dependent objects (constituent data blocks or child inodes).  During the next file system detection, it is recognized that the objects belong to a deleted inode, so they are not restored into the RAM representation.\n\n\nIf a file has an open handle at the time it gets unlinked, application code can continued to use the file handle to read and write data.  All files retain a reference count, and a file isn't deleted from the RAM representation until its reference code drops to 0.  Any attempt to open an unlinked file fails, even if the file is referenced by other file handles.\n\n\nWriting to a file\n\n\nThe following procedure is used whenever the application code writes to a file.  First, if the write operation specifies too much data to fit into a single block, the operation is split into several separate write operations.  Then, for each write operation:\n\n\n\n\nDetermine which existing blocks the write operation overlaps (n = number of overwritten blocks).\n\n\nIf \nn = 0\n, this is an append operation.  Write a data block with the following properties:\n\n\nID:\n New unique value.\n\n\nSequence number:\n 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElse \n(n > 1)\n, this write overlaps existing data.\n\n\nFor each block in \n[1, 2, ... n-1]\n, write a new block containing the updated contents.  Each new block supersedes the block it overwrites.  That is, each block has the following properties:\n\n\nID:\n Unchanged\n\n\nSequence number:\n Previous value plus one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the nth block.  The nth block includes all appended data, if any.  As with the other blocks, its ID is unchanged and its sequence number is incremented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppended data can only be written to the end of the file.  That is, \"holes\" are not supported.\n\n\nGarbage collection\n\n\nWhen the file system is too full to accommodate a write operation, the system must perform garbage collection to make room.  The garbage collection procedure is described below:\n\n\n\n\nThe non-scratch area with the lowest garbage collection sequence number is selected as the \"source area.\"  If there are other areas with the same sequence number, the one with the smallest flash offset is selected. \n\n\nThe source area's ID is written to the scratch area's header, transforming it into a non-scratch ID.  This former scratch area is now known as the \"destination area.\"\n\n\nThe RAM representation is exhaustively searched for collectible objects.  The following procedure is applied to each inode in the system:\n\n\nIf the inode is resident in the source area, copy the inode record to the destination area.\n\n\nIf the inode is a file inode, walk the inode's list of data blocks, starting with the last block in the file.  Each block that is resident in the source area is copied to the destination area.  If there is a run of two or more blocks that are resident in the source area, they are consolidated and copied to the destination area as a single new block (subject to the maximum block size restriction).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source area is reformatted as a scratch sector (i.e., is is fully erased, and its header is rewritten with an ID of 0xff).  The area's garbage collection sequence number is incremented prior to rewriting the header.  This area is now the new scratch sector.",

            "text": "The speed issues are addressed by a pair of caches.  Cached inodes entries contain the file length and a much more convenient doubly-linked list of cached data blocks.  The benefit of using caches is that the size of the caches need not be proportional to the size of the file system.  In other words, caches can address speed efficiency concerns without negatively impacting the file system's scalability.  nffs requires both caches during normal operation, so it is not possible to disable them.  However, the cache sizes are configurable, and both caches can be configured with a size of one if RAM usage must be minimized.  The following data structures are used in the inode and data block caches.  /** Full data block representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */  struct   nffs_block  {\n     struct   nffs_hash_entry   *nb_hash_entry ;    /* Points to real block entry. */ \n     uint32_t   nb_seq ;                          /* Sequence number; greater                                                  supersedes lesser. */ \n     struct   nffs_inode_entry   *nb_inode_entry ;  /* Owning inode. */ \n     struct   nffs_hash_entry   *nb_prev ;          /* Previous block in file. */ \n     uint16_t   nb_data_len ;                     /* # of data bytes in block. */ \n     uint16_t   reserved16 ;\n};  /** Represents a single cached data block. */  struct   nffs_cache_block  {\n     TAILQ_ENTRY ( nffs_cache_block )  ncb_link ;  /* Next / prev cached block. */ \n     struct   nffs_block   ncb_block ;             /* Full data block. */ \n     uint32_t   ncb_file_offset ;                /* File offset of this block. */ \n};  /** Full inode representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */  struct   nffs_inode  {\n     struct   nffs_inode_entry   *ni_inode_entry ;  /* Points to real inode entry. */ \n     uint32_t   ni_seq ;                          /* Sequence number; greater                                                  supersedes lesser. */ \n     struct   nffs_inode_entry   *ni_parent ;       /* Points to parent directory. */ \n     uint8_t   ni_filename_len ;                  /* # chars in filename. */ \n     uint8_t   ni_filename [ NFFS_SHORT_FILENAME_LEN ];  /* First 3 bytes. */ \n};  /** Doubly-linked tail queue of cached blocks; contained in cached inodes. */  TAILQ_HEAD ( nffs_block_cache_list ,  nffs_block_cache_entry ); /** Represents a single cached file inode. */  struct   nffs_cache_inode  {\n     TAILQ_ENTRY ( nffs_cache_inode )  nci_link ;         /* Sorted; LRU at tail. */ \n     struct   nffs_inode   nci_inode ;                    /* Full inode. */ \n     struct   nffs_cache_block_list   nci_block_list ;    /* List of cached blocks. */ \n     uint32_t   nci_file_size ;                         /* Total file size. */ \n};  Only file inodes are cached; directory inodes are never cached.  Within a cached inode, all cached data blocks are contiguous.  E.g., if the start and end of a file are cached, then the middle must also be cached.  A data block is only cached if its owning file is also cached.  Internally, cached inodes are stored in a singly-linked list, ordered by time of use.  The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list.  If a new inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the least-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one.  The following operations cause an inode to be cached:   Querying a file's length.  Seeking within a file.  Reading from a file.  Writing to a file.   The following operations cause a data block to be cached:   Reading from the block.  Writing to the block.   If one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently cached, nffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary block:   If none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a cached block entry corresponding to the requested block and insert it into the inode's list.  Else if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and the block that now needs to be cached.  This is accomplished by caching each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block.  Else (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache),  If the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the list.  Else, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry corresponding to the requested block.     If the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during the above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache. This is accomplished as follows:   Iterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the least-recently-used entry).  For each entry:  If the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next entry.  Else, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list.     Because the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above procedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry.  The above procedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very inode being operated on.  This is OK, as the final block to get cached is always the block being requested.",

            "text": "The file system detection process consists of scanning a specified set of flash regions for valid nffs areas, and then populating the RAM representation of the file system with the detected objects.  Detection is initiated with the  nffs_detect()  function.  Not every area descriptor passed to  nffs_detect()  needs to reference a valid nffs area.  Detection is successful as long as a complete file system is detected somewhere in the specified regions of flash.  If an application is unsure where a file system might be located, it can initiate detection across the entire flash region.  A detected file system is valid if:   At least one non-scratch area is present.  At least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if there is more than one).  The root directory inode is present.   During detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area header.  The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into the nffs RAM representation.  The following procedure is applied to each object in the area:   Verify the object's integrity via a crc16 check.  If invalid, the object is discarded and the procedure restarts on the next object in the area.  Convert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and insert it into the hash table.  If the object is an inode, its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by its parent directory.  If an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes the other.  Accept the object with the greater sequence number and discard the other.  If the object references a nonexistent inode (parent directory in the case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a temporary \"dummy\" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored.  Dummy inodes are identified by a reference count of 0.  If a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode's parent pointer is set to null to indicate that it should be removed from RAM.   If nffs encounters an object that cannot be identified (i.e., its magic number is not valid), it scans the remainder of the flash area for the next valid magic number.  Upon encountering a valid object, nffs resumes the procedure described above.  After all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM representation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory.  For each directory inode:   If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), migrate its children to the  /lost+found  directory, and delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.  If its parent reference is null (i.e., it was deleted), delete it and all its children from the RAM representation.   For each file inode:   If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), delete it from the RAM representation.  This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.  (We should try to migrate the file to the lost+found directory in this case, as mentioned in the todo section).   When an object is deleted during this sweep, it is only deleted from the RAM representation; nothing is written to disk.  When objects are migrated to the lost+found directory, their parent inode reference is permanently updated on the disk.  In addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process.  The first area whose  fda_id  value is set to 0xff is designated as the file system scratch area.  If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be that the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress.  Such a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID.  In such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the scratch area.",

The light switch module needs a GPIO pin to set\nthe light switch to on or off.  The module declares that the GPIO to \ncontrol the light switch is declared elsewhere in one of two methods.     extern const int light_switch_gpio;  or      extern int bsp_light_app_get_light_gpio();  Which method a library uses \n(extern const versus function) depends on what functionality the library\nmight wish to declare.  The  extern const  model uses the smallest code \nfootprint, but since its constant cannot be changed at runtime (based on \nthe configuration of the device say).  The  extern function  call requires\nthe BSP to implement a function which allows flexibility to assign the \nGPIO for the light switch to be determined at runtime with a small expense of\nslightly more code.  Then the  libs/light  would go on to use the specified GPIO during its runtime\nexecution. For example this shows both ways the library could interface to the \nbsp to get the right GPIO:      void light_on(void) {\n        . . .\n        /* finally time to turn the light on */\n        hal_gpio_set(light_switch_gpio);\n    }\n\n    void light_on(void) {\n        . . .\n        int pin = bsp_light_app_get_light_gpio();\n        /* finally time to turn the light on */\n        hal_gpio_set(pin);\n    }  When you library user includes  libs/light  as a dependency and then builds\nwith  newt , they will get an unresolved external for either  light_switch_gpio  \nor  bsp_light_app_get_light_gpio()  and will need to add to their BSP.  In their BSP, they can add      const int light_switch_gpio = 5;  or     int bsp_light_app_get_light_gpio(void) {\n        return my_configured_lightswitch_io();\n   }  So where did the number  5  come from.

Image manager interacts with bootloader by telling it to boot to a specific image. At the moment this has to be done by writing a file which contains a version number of the image to boot. Note that image manager itself does not replace the active image.  Image manager also can upload files to filesystem as well as download them.  Note that commands accessing filesystems (next boot target, file upload/download) will not be available unless project includes filesystem implementation.",

When building stats, the implementer chooses the size of the \nstatistic depending on the frequency of the statistic and the \nresolution required before the counter wraps.    \n\n\nTypically the stats are incremented upon code events; however, they are \nnot limted to that purpose.  \n\n\nStats are organized into sections. Each section of stats has its own\nname and can be queried separately through the API.  Each section of stats\nalso has its own statistic size, allowing the user to separate large (64-bit)\nstatistics from small (16 bit statistics).  NOTE:  It is not currently possible\nto group different size stats into the same section.  Please ensure all stats\nin a section have the same size.\n\n\nStats sections are currently stored in a single global stats group.  \n\n\nStatistics are stored in a simple structure which contains a small\nstats header followed by a list of stats.

This is defined using \n\n\npkg.clfags: -DSTATS_NAME_ENABLE\n\n\n\n\n\nin your apps pkg.yml file or \n\n\ntarget.clfags: -DSTATS_NAME_ENABLE\n\n\n\n\n\nin your target definition.\n\n\nEnabling stat names provides better descriptions in the reported stats,\nbut takes code space to store the strings within the image.\n\n\n\n\nAdding Stats to your code.\n\n\nCreating new stats table requires the following steps.\n\n\n\n\nInclude the stats header file \n\n\nDefine a stats section\n\n\nDeclare an instance of the section \n\n\nDefine the stat sections names table\n\n\nImplement stat in your code\n\n\nInitialize the stats\n\n\nRegister the stats\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude the stats header file\n\n\nAdd the stats library to your pkg.yml file for your package or app by adding\nthis line to your package dependencies.\n\n\npkg.deps:\n    - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/stats\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd this include directive to code files using the stats library.\n\n\n#include <stats/stats.h>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine a stats section\n\n\nYou must use the \nstats.h\n macros to define your stats table.

My\ndriver supports up to 5 sensors and I want to record the stats of \neach device separately.\n\n\nThis works identically to the example above, except you would need to \nregister each one separately with a unique name.

In the second variant, private addresses are resolved and generated by the  Controller  without involving the Host after the Host provides the Controller device identity information. The Host may provide the Controller with a complete resolving list or a subset of the resolving list.    Device filtering becomes possible in the second variant when address resolution is performed in the Controller because the peer\u2019s device identity address can be resolved prior to checking whether it is in the white list.  Note : When address resolution is performed exclusively in the Host, a device may experience increased power consumption because device filtering must be disabled.  For more details on the privacy feature, refer to BLUETOOTH SPECIFICATION Version 4.2 [Vol 3, Part C] (Published 02 December 2014), Page 592.",

We will call this target \"ble_tgt\". Type the \nnewt target create ble_tgt\n command. You should get this:\n\n\n~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target create ble_tgt\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully created\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this command just did was to create a directory called \nble_tgt\n in the targets directory of your project. Two files are created in that directory: pkg.yml and target.yml.\n\n\nThe target is not yet complete though! We need to set some target variables for this project. Currently, the nimble stack has been ported to the Nordic nrf5x chipsets; specifically the nrf51 and nrf52. This application will use the nrf52 but we will also show the setup for the nrf51 in case your project uses that chip.\n\n\nHere is the command you will need to set up your target for the nrf52:\n\n\n~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target set ble_tgt     \\\n    app=apps/ble_app                        \\\n    bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52pdk \\\n    build_profile=optimized\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.app to apps/ble_app\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52pdk\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.build_profile to optimized\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the command you will need to set up your target for the nrf51:\n\n\n~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target set ble_tgt     \\\n    app=apps/ble_app                        \\\n    bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk  \\\n    build_profile=optimized\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.app to apps/ble_app\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.build_profile to optimized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNimble stack initialization\n\n\nThere are certain stack initialization steps that are required for a BLE application to be up and running. If you are running a canned example (e.g. bletiny), these steps are already done for you. When you are writing your own app, you may want to assign different initial values or initialize additional packages that you may have added to your project or written yourself. \n\n\nDetails of the initialization step requirements are covered in \nInitialize Stack\n step.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the application\n\n\nNow that we have created the application and the target we can build it and test it out. The command you need to run is the \nnewt build\n command with the target we created (\nble_tgt\n). The output will show the files being compiled and linked. You should see this when all is done (except for the \n...\n of course):\n\n\n~/dev/my_proj1$ newt build ble_tgt\n...\nArchiving os.a\nCompiling cons_fmt.c\nCompiling cons_tty.c\nArchiving full.a\nLinking ble_app.elf\nApp successfully built: /Users/wes/dev/my_proj1/bin/ble_tgt/apps/ble_app/ble_app.elf\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nYou now have a fully functional BLE app (never mind the fact that it doesn't\nactually do anything yet!).  With all the necessary infrastructure in place,\nyou can now start turning this into a real application.  Additional tutorials\nwith focus on adding application-layer functionality to your Nimble application\nwill be coming soon.  In the meantime, you might get some inspiration from\napache-mynewt-core's example Nimble apps.

            "text": "Create the System Memory Buffer Pool\n\n\nThe Nimble stack allocates packet buffers (called mbufs) from the system memory buffer pool (msys). The system memory buffer pool and mbufs are described in the OS manual; we suggest reading that section in order to become familiar with mbufs if you are not already familiar with them. Note that the application itself (the unique application code that you are writing) does not need to use mbufs and none of the BLE host API exposed to the application developer uses them. However, the Nimble stack does require the existence of the system memory pool.\n\n\nCreating the memory pool and registering it with the system memory buffer pool can be a bit tricky the first time. However, using the template provided below it should be much easier. The header file /net/nimble/include/nimble/ble.h, which should be included in main.c, contains some MBUF macros that you will need to create the memory pool used by msys. The macro \nBLE_MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE\n defines the maximum amount of user payload, plus overhead, that a link layer BLE PDU can contain. The macro \nBLE_MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD\n is the amount of overhead required by the Nimble stack in each memory block used by the mbuf pool. The macro \nMBUF_NUM_MBUFS\n defines the number of mbufs in the mbuf pool and is defined locally. The user must determine, based on application requirements and platform memory size, how many mbufs are required. For example, if your application expects to have many simultaneous connections you may want to increase the size of the mbuf pool. In the example below, we assume you are only using a small number of active connections (2 to 3).\n\n\nA note about the size of the mbufs and \nBLE_MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE\n. Msys allows for multiple mbuf pools of various size. Currently, the Nimble stack requires that msys has an mbuf pool registered that can accommodate the maximum size BLE LL PDU.

            "text": "The Nimble stack allocates packet buffers (called mbufs) from the system memory buffer pool (msys). The system memory buffer pool and mbufs are described in the OS manual; we suggest reading that section in order to become familiar with mbufs if you are not already familiar with them. Note that the application itself (the unique application code that you are writing) does not need to use mbufs and none of the BLE host API exposed to the application developer uses them. However, the Nimble stack does require the existence of the system memory pool.  Creating the memory pool and registering it with the system memory buffer pool can be a bit tricky the first time. However, using the template provided below it should be much easier. The header file /net/nimble/include/nimble/ble.h, which should be included in main.c, contains some MBUF macros that you will need to create the memory pool used by msys. The macro  BLE_MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE  defines the maximum amount of user payload, plus overhead, that a link layer BLE PDU can contain. The macro  BLE_MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD  is the amount of overhead required by the Nimble stack in each memory block used by the mbuf pool. The macro  MBUF_NUM_MBUFS  defines the number of mbufs in the mbuf pool and is defined locally. The user must determine, based on application requirements and platform memory size, how many mbufs are required. For example, if your application expects to have many simultaneous connections you may want to increase the size of the mbuf pool. In the example below, we assume you are only using a small number of active connections (2 to 3).  A note about the size of the mbufs and  BLE_MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE . Msys allows for multiple mbuf pools of various size. Currently, the Nimble stack requires that msys has an mbuf pool registered that can accommodate the maximum size BLE LL PDU. Thus, we only show the creation of one mbuf pool of maximum size mbufs which gets registered to the system mbuf memory pool. We plan on modifying the Nimble stack so that smaller mbufs can be used (to conserve memory) but at this point in time you cannot modify  BLE_MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE .

Packages can export APIs they \nimplement, (i.e. pkg.api: hw-hal-impl), and other packages can require \nthose APIs (i.e. pkg.req_api: hw-hal-impl).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Features\" options are supported.  Packages can change what dependencies \nthey have, or what flags they are using based upon what features are enabled in the system.  As an example, many packages will add additional software, based on whether the shell package is present.  To do this, they can overwrite cflags or deps based upon the shell \"feature.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg.cflags.SHELL: -DSHELL_PRESENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to properly resolve all dependencies in the build system, Newt recursively processes the package dependencies until there are no new dependencies or features (because features can add dependencies.)  And it builds a big list of all the packages that need to be build.\n\n\nNewt then goes through this package list, and builds every package into \nan archive file.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The Newt tool generates compiler dependencies for all of these packages, and only rebuilds the packages whose dependencies have changed. Changes in package & project dependencies are also taken into account. It is smart, after all!\n\n\nProducing artifacts\n\n\nOnce Newt has built all the archive files, it then links the archive files together.  The linkerscript to use is specified by the board support package (BSP.)\n\n\nNOTE: One common use of the \"features\" option above is to overwrite \nwhich linkerscript is used, based upon whether or not the BSP is being \nbuild for a raw image, bootable image or bootloader itself.\n\n\nThe newt tool places all of it's artifacts into the bin/ directory at \nthe top-level of the project, prefixed by the target name being built, \nfor example:\n\n\n$ tree -L 4 bin/\nbin/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 my_blinky_sim\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 apps\n     \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 blinky\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.a\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.a.cmd\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.elf\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.elf.cmd\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.elf.dSYM\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.elf.lst\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.d\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.o\n     \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.o.cmd\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 hw\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 bsp\n     \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 native\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 hal\n     \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 flash_map.d\n     \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 flash_map.o\n<snip>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, a number of files are generated:\n\n\n\n\nArchive File\n\n\n*.cmd: The command use to generate the object or archive file\n\n\n*.lst: The list file where symbols are located\n\n\n*.o The object files that get put into the archive file\n\n\n\n\nDownload/Debug Support\n\n\nOnce a target has been build, there are a number of helper functions \nthat work on the target.  These are:\n\n\n\n\ndownload\n     Download built target to board\n\n\ndebug\n        Open debugger session to target\n\n\nsize         Size of target components\n\n\ncreate-image Add image header to target binary\n\n\n\n\nDownload and debug handles driving GDB and the system debugger.

Packages can export APIs they \nimplement, (i.e. pkg.api: hw-hal-impl), and other packages can require \nthose APIs (i.e. pkg.req_api: hw-hal-impl).    \"Features\" options are supported.  Packages can change what dependencies \nthey have, or what flags they are using based upon what features are enabled in the system.  As an example, many packages will add additional software, based on whether the shell package is present.  To do this, they can overwrite cflags or deps based upon the shell \"feature.\"    pkg.cflags.SHELL: -DSHELL_PRESENT   In order to properly resolve all dependencies in the build system, Newt recursively processes the package dependencies until there are no new dependencies or features (because features can add dependencies.)  And it builds a big list of all the packages that need to be build.  Newt then goes through this package list, and builds every package into \nan archive file.  NOTE:  The Newt tool generates compiler dependencies for all of these packages, and only rebuilds the packages whose dependencies have changed. Changes in package & project dependencies are also taken into account. It is smart, after all!",

You can read about it at \nhttp://www.mkdocs.org\n. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool (which in our case is MkDocs).\n\n\nThe HTML pages are generated periodically after changes have been reviewed and accepted into the master branch.\n\n\nAccess to the Apache repo\n\n\nGet an account on Apache. You do not need a committer account to view the website or clone the repository but you need it to push changes to it.\n\n\nIf you are not a committer, you may follow the proposed non-committer workflow to share your work. The direct link to the proposed workflow is \nhttps://git-wip-us.apache.org/docs/workflow.html\n. You will find the steps described in more detail later in this tutorial.\n\n\nEditing an existing page\n\n\n\n\nCreate a fork on the \ngithub mirror\n. \n\n\n\n\nThen create a new branch to work on your documentation and move to that branch.\n\n\n\n\n        $ git checkout -b <your-branch-name>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake changes directly on github.com. Generate a pull request. Alternatively, you can edit locally on your machine, push the branch (or the changes in the branch) to your fork on github.com, and then generate a pull request.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a new page\n\n\nIf you create a new file somewhere in the \ndocs\n subdirectory to add a new page, you have to add a line in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file at the correct level. For example, if you add a new module named \"Wi-Fi\" by creating a new file named \nwifi.md\n in the \nnetwork\n directory, you have to insert the following line under \nNetworking User Guide\n in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file (at the same level as the \ndocs\n directory). In this example, a link will show up in the navigation bar on the left under \"Networking User Guide\" titled \"Wi-Fi\" and take the user to the contents of the 'wifi.md' file when the link is clicked. \n Note: The change will show up on this \nMynewt site\n only after your pull request is merged in and the updated site is generated.\n\n\n        - 'Wi-Fi': 'wifi.md'\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal preview of HTML files\n\n\nYou have the option to install MkDocs and do a local conversion yourself to preview the pages using the built-in webserver that comes with MkDocs. In order to install MkDocs you'll need Python installed on your system, as well as the Python package manager, pip. You can check if you have them already (usually you will).\n\n\n        $ python --version\n        Python 2.7.2\n        $ pip --version\n        pip 1.5.2\n        $ pip install mkdocs\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will then run the built-in webserver from the root of the documentation directory using the command \nmkdocs serve\n. The root directory for documentation is \nincubator-mynewt-site\n or the directory with the \nmkdocs.yml\n file.\n\n\n        $ ls\n        docs        images      mkdocs.yml\n        $ mkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\n\nThen go to \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000\n to preview your pages and see how they will look on the website. \nRemember that the Myself website itself will not be updated.\n\n\nFor more information on MkDocs go to \nhttp://www.mkdocs.org\n.",

Contributions from you need to go into this branch. The essential steps to setting up your project space for working with the latest code from \"develop\" and make pull requests into \"develop\" to get your code added are the following:\n\n\nStep 1:\n Create a fork of the entire Mynewt repository on github.com.\n\n\nStep 2:\n Setup repository on your laptop to use code in \u201cdevelop\u201d branch. You then create a new branch \u201cmybranch\u201d using \u201cgit checkout \u2013b\u201d. You also add a remote handle named \u201cfork\u201d that points to the github fork you created in Step 1.\n\n\n    $ newt new devproject\n    $ cd devproject\n    $ vi project.yml\n        # change version to 0-dev for repository.apache-mynewt-core\n    $ newt install\n    $ cd repos/apache-mynewt-core\n    $ git status\n        On branch develop\n        Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/develop'.\n        nothing to commit, working directory clean\n    $ git checkout \u2013b mybranch\n    $ git remote -v\n        origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (fetch) \n        origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (push)\n    $ git remote add fork https://github.com/<user>/incubator-mynewt-core \n    $ git remote -v\n        origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (fetch) \n        origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (push)\n        fork https://github.com/<user>/incubator-mynewt-core (fetch) \n        fork https://github.com/<user>/incubator-mynewt-core (push)\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n Check you are in \u201cmybranch\u201d. Write code. Stage and commit your changes\n(example shows adding all).\n\n\n   $ git checkout mybranch\n   $ git add .\n   $ git commit \u2013m \u201cyour message about your code changes\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n Always pull the latest from develop on Apache mirror to \u201cmybranch\u201d before pushing any changes to remotes. If you see merge conflicts, resolve them first.\n\n\n   $ git pull --rebase origin develop\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n Push your changes to \u201cmybranch\u201d branch on your github fork. If \u201cmybranch\u201d does not exist yet on your github fork, the command automa;cally creates it.\n\n\n   $ git push fork mybranch\n\n\n\n\n\n\ufffcStep 6:\n Generate a pull request from \u201cmybranch\u201d in your fork to \u201cdevelop\u201d in Mynewt using the \"New pull request\" button on github.com.\n\n\n\n\nI would like to make some edits to the documentation. What do I do?\n\n\n\n\nYou submit your proposed changes for your peers with committer status to review and merge. \n\n\nGo to the \ndocumentation mirror\n on github.com.\n\n\nNavigate to the file you wish to edit on github.com. All the technical documentation is in Markdown files under the \n/docs\n directory. Click on the pencil icon (\"Edit the file in your fork of this project\") and start making changes.\n\n\nClick the green \"Propose file change\" button. You will be directed to the page where you can start a pull request from the branch that was created for you. The branch is gets an automatic name \npatch-#\n where # is a number. Click on the green \"Compare & pull request\" to open the pull request.\n\n\nIn the comment for the pull request, include a description of the changes you have made and why. Github will automatically notify everyone on the commits@mynewt.incubator.apache.org mailing list about the newly opened pull requests. You can open a pull request even if you don't think the code is ready for merging but want some discussion on the matter.\n\n\nUpon receiving notification, one or more committers will review your work, ask for edits or clarifications, and merge when your proposed changes are ready.\n\n\nIf you want to withdraw the pull request simply go to your fork \nhttps://github.com/<your github username>/incubator-mynewt-site\n and click on \"branches\". You should see your branch under \"Your branches\". Click on the delete icon.\n\n\nI would like to make some edits to the documentation but want to use an editor on my own laptop. What do I do?\n\n\n\n\nYou submit your proposed changes for your peers with committer status to review and merge. \n\n\nGo to the \ndocumentation mirror\n on github.com. You need to create your own fork of the repo in github.com by clicking on the \"Fork\" button on the top right. Clone the forked repository into your laptop (using \ngit clone\n from a terminal or using the download buttons on the github page)and create a local branch for the edits and switching to it (using \ngit checkout -b <new-branchname>\n or GitHub Desktop). \n\n\nMake your changes using the editor of your choice. Push that branch to your fork on github. Then submit a pull request from that branch on your github fork.\n\n\nThe review and merge process is the same as other pull requests described for earlier questions.",

The \"develop\" branch on Mynewt's repository contains the most recent changes made by the community of developers. Contributions from you need to go into this branch. The essential steps to setting up your project space for working with the latest code from \"develop\" and make pull requests into \"develop\" to get your code added are the following:  Step 1:  Create a fork of the entire Mynewt repository on github.com.  Step 2:  Setup repository on your laptop to use code in \u201cdevelop\u201d branch. You then create a new branch \u201cmybranch\u201d using \u201cgit checkout \u2013b\u201d. You also add a remote handle named \u201cfork\u201d that points to the github fork you created in Step 1.      $ newt new devproject\n    $ cd devproject\n    $ vi project.yml\n        # change version to 0-dev for repository.apache-mynewt-core\n    $ newt install\n    $ cd repos/apache-mynewt-core\n    $ git status\n        On branch develop\n        Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/develop'.\n        nothing to commit, working directory clean\n    $ git checkout \u2013b mybranch\n    $ git remote -v\n        origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (fetch) \n        origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (push)\n    $ git remote add fork https://github.com/<user>/incubator-mynewt-core \n    $ git remote -v\n        origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (fetch) \n        origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (push)\n        fork https://github.com/<user>/incubator-mynewt-core (fetch) \n        fork https://github.com/<user>/incubator-mynewt-core (push)  Step 3:  Check you are in \u201cmybranch\u201d. Write code. Stage and commit your changes\n(example shows adding all).     $ git checkout mybranch\n   $ git add .\n   $ git commit \u2013m \u201cyour message about your code changes\u201d  Step 4:  Always pull the latest from develop on Apache mirror to \u201cmybranch\u201d before pushing any changes to remotes. If you see merge conflicts, resolve them first.     $ git pull --rebase origin develop  Step 5:  Push your changes to \u201cmybranch\u201d branch on your github fork. If \u201cmybranch\u201d does not exist yet on your github fork, the command automa;cally creates it.     $ git push fork mybranch  \ufffcStep 6:  Generate a pull request from \u201cmybranch\u201d in your fork to \u201cdevelop\u201d in Mynewt using the \"New pull request\" button on github.com.",

Github will automatically notify everyone on the commits@mynewt.incubator.apache.org mailing list about the newly opened pull requests. You can open a pull request even if you don't think the code is ready for merging but want some discussion on the matter.  Upon receiving notification, one or more committers will review your work, ask for edits or clarifications, and merge when your proposed changes are ready.
